"Margaret MacDonald (visionary)
Margaret MacDonald was born in 1815 in Port Glasgow, Scotland and died around 1840.  She lived with her two older brothers, James and George, both of whom ran a shipping business.  Beginning in 1826 and through 1829, a few preachers in Scotland emphasized that the world's problems could only be addressed through an outbreak of supernatural gifts from the Holy Spirit.  In response, Isabella and Mary Campbell of the parish of Rosneath manifested charismatic experiences such as speaking in tongues.  Around 1830, miraculous healings were reported through James Campbell, first of his sister Margaret MacDonald and then of Mary Campbell (through James's letter to Mary).  Shortly thereafter, James and George MacDonald manifested the speaking and interpretations of tongues, and soon others followed suit in prayer meetings.  These charismatic experiences garnered major national attention.  Many came to see and investigate these events.  Some, such as Edward Irving and Henry Drummond, regarded these events as genuine displays from the Holy Spirit.  Others, including John Nelson Darby and Benjamin Wills Newton, whom the Plymouth Brethren sent on their behalf to investigate, came to the conclusion that these displays were demonic.

"Proximity effect (superconductivity)
Proximity effect or Holm-Meissner effect is a term used in the field of superconductivity to describe phenomena that occur when a superconductor (S) is placed in contact with a ""normal"" (N) non-superconductor.  Typically the critical temperature formula_1 of the superconductor is suppressed and signs of weak superconductivity are observed in the normal material over mesoscopic distances.  The proximity effect is known since the pioneering work by R. Holm and W. Meissner.  They have observed zero resistance in SNS pressed contacts, in which two superconducting metals are separated by a thin film of a non-superconducting (i.e. normal) metal.  The discovery of the supercurrent in SNS contacts is sometimes mistakenly attributed to Brian Josephson's 1962 work, yet the effect was known long before his publication and was understood as the proximity effect.

Initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic vein of Weber and Meyerbeer, Wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the ""Gesamtkunstwerk"" (""total work of art""), by which he sought to synthesise the poetic, visual, musical and dramatic arts, with music subsidiary to drama.  He described this vision in a series of essays published between 1849 and 1852.  Wagner realised these ideas most fully in the first half of the four-opera cycle ""Der Ring des Nibelungen"" (""The Ring of the Nibelung"").

"2005 Oregon Ducks football team
In 2005, Oregon had success behind senior quarterback Kellen Clemens and a new spread offense.  During a game at Arizona, Clemens suffered a broken ankle.  At that point Oregon was 8-1 (their only loss was to #1 ranked USC 45-13, the loss was vacated in 2010), and still in the hunt for a BCS game.  Oregon won their final three games and their success led them into contention for a bid to the Fiesta Bowl.  The Ducks finished the regular season with a 10-1 record, their best finish since their Joey Harrington-led, Fiesta Bowl-winning 2001–2002 team.  They finished 5th overall in the BCS ranking system, which would in many years have been high enough to earn them a bid to a BCS Bowl.  In 2005, however, there were no at-large bids available to Oregon.  Ohio State finished just ahead of the Ducks, in 4th place, guaranteeing them one of the at-large berths (although they had an inferior 10-2 record).  Notre Dame finished 6th in the BCS, also securing a BCS bid due to a pre-existing clause in the BCS contract.  Many college football fans were outraged that two teams with worse records were selected over the Ducks.  Moreover, for the second consecutive year, the Pac-10 conference had a team that finished with a one-loss season snubbed by the BCS (the Cal Bears finished 10-1 in 2004).  It was later demonstrated that Oregon drew the highest bowl ratings in college football, calling the argument that TV ratings hurt the Ducks' BCS chances into question.  The situation (and others like it in recent years) has led to more calls for a playoff system to replace the BCS, which has received widespread criticism from college football fans.  Instead of a BCS game, they were assigned to the 2005 Holiday Bowl versus the Oklahoma Sooners.  Playing without their starting quarterback, Kellen Clemens, and combined with a strong showing from the Sooners, the Ducks fell in a close game, 17-14, finishing the season tied for the second-best in school history with a 10-1 overall record (the Southern Cal game was deemed vacated by violations in 2010).

"History of New York University
The history of New York University begins in the early 19th century.  A group of prominent New York City residents from the city's landed class of merchants, bankers, and traders established NYU on April 18, 1831.  These New Yorkers believed the city needed a university designed for young men who would be admitted based on merit, not birthright or social class.  Albert Gallatin, Secretary of the Treasury under Thomas Jefferson, described his motivation in a letter to a friend: ""It appeared to me impossible to preserve our democratic institutions and the right of universal suffrage unless we could raise the standard of general education and the mind of the laboring classes nearer to a level with those born under more favorable circumstances.""  To the school's founders, the classical curriculum offered at American colonial colleges needed to be combined with a more modern and practical education.  Educators in Paris, Vienna, and London were beginning to consider a new form of higher learning, where students began to focus not only on the classics and religion, but also modern languages, philosophy, history, political economy, mathematics, and physical science; so students might become merchants, bankers, lawyers, physicians, architects, and engineers.  Although the new school would be non-denominational – unlike many American colonial colleges, which at the time offered classical educations centered on theology – the founding of NYU was also a reaction by evangelical Presbyterians to what they perceived as the Episcopalianism of Columbia College.

"Principle of charity
In philosophy and rhetoric, the principle of charity requires interpreting a speaker's statements to be rational and, in the case of any argument, considering its best, strongest possible interpretation.

According to Simon Blackburn ""it constrains the interpreter to maximize the truth or rationality in the subject's sayings.""

The theory explains why some of the properties of an interacting fermion system are very similar to those of the Fermi gas (i.e. non-interacting fermions), and why other properties differ.

"Louis Sarecky
Louis Sarecky (January 26, 1886 – March 4, 1946) was an American film producer and screenwriter at the very beginning of the sound era of motion pictures.  Born in 1886 in Odessa in what was then the Russian Empire (today now part of Ukraine), he began his career in the last year of silent film, 1928, working on five films that year, four as screenwriter and one as producer.  While he is only credited with working on 26 films, some of those were among the most popular films at that time: ""The Vagabond Lover"" (1929), Rudy Vallée's screen debut; ""The Cuckoos"", starring the comedy team of Wheeler & Woolsey; and ""Friends and Lovers"" in 1931, starring Adolphe Menjou and Laurence Olivier.  His crowning achievement would be the Academy Award-winning 1931 film ""Cimarron"".  Sarecky was the associate producer on the film, as well as helping adapt the screenplay, although he was uncredited for the latter.  Since the film won the Oscar for both outstanding production and best adapted screenplay, he would have the dubious distinction of contributing in both those fields, yet not receiving an Academy Award himself (William LeBaron would receive the Outstanding Production Oscar, while Howard Estabrook would get the writing statue).

It would be RKO's most expensive production up to that date, and its winning of the top Oscar for Best Production would be only one of two ever won by that studio.  It is also one of the few Westerns to ever win the top honor at the Academy Awards.  Epic in scope, spanning forty years from 1889 to 1929, it was a critical success, although it did not recoup its production costs during its initial run in 1931.

"December 1992 nor'easter
The December 1992 nor'easter produced record high tides and snowfall across the northeastern United States.  It developed as a low pressure area on December 10 over Virginia, and for two days it remained over the Mid-Atlantic states before moving offshore.  In Maryland, the snowfall unofficially reached 48 in ; if verified, the total would have been the highest in the state's history.  About 120,000 people were left without power in the state due to high winds.  Along the Maryland coast, the storm was less severe than the Perfect Storm in the previous year, although the strongest portion of the storm remained over New Jersey for several days.  In the state, winds reached 80 mph in Cape May, and tides peaked at 10.4 ft in Perth Amboy.  The combination of high tides and 25 ft waves caused the most significant flooding in the state since the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962.  Several highways and portions of the New York City Subway and Port Authority Trans-Hudson systems were closed due to the storm.  Throughout New Jersey, the nor'easter damaged about 3,200 homes and caused an estimated $750 million in damage (1992 USD).

1991 Perfect Storm
The 1991 Perfect Storm, also known as The No-Name Storm (especially in the years immediately after it took place) and the Halloween Gale, was a nor'easter that absorbed Hurricane Grace and ultimately evolved back into a small unnamed hurricane late in its life cycle.  The initial area of low pressure developed off Atlantic Canada on October 29.  Forced southward by a ridge to its north, it reached its peak intensity as a large and powerful cyclone.  The storm lashed the east coast of the United States with high waves and coastal flooding before turning to the southwest and weakening.  Moving over warmer waters, the system transitioned into a subtropical cyclone before becoming a tropical storm.  It executed a loop off the Mid-Atlantic states and turned toward the northeast.  On November 1 the system evolved into a full-fledged hurricane with peak winds of 75 miles per hour (120 km/h), although the National Hurricane Center left it unnamed to avoid confusion amid media interest in the predecessor extratropical storm.  It later received the name ""the Perfect Storm"" (playing off the common expression) after a conversation between Boston National Weather Service forecaster Robert Case and author Sebastian Junger.  The system was the fourth hurricane and final tropical cyclone in the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season.  The tropical system weakened, striking Nova Scotia as a tropical storm before dissipating.

Stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy is one of the techniques that make up super-resolution microscopy.  It creates super-resolution images by the selective deactivation of fluorophores, minimising the area of illumination at the focal point, and thus enhancing the achievable resolution for a given system.  It was developed by Stefan W. Hell and Jan Wichmann in 1994, and was first experimentally demonstrated by Hell and Thomas Klar in 1999.  Hell was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2014 for its development.  In 1986, V.A.

"Prussia (region)
Prussia (Old Prussian: ""Prūsa"", German: ""Preußen"" , Lithuanian: ""Prūsija"" , Polish: ""Prusy"" ) is a historical region stretching from Gdańsk Bay to the end of Curonian Spit on the southeastern coast of the Baltic Sea, and extending inland as far as Masuria.  The territory and inhabitants were described by Tacitus in Germania in AD 98, where Suebi, Goths and other Germanic people lived on both sides of the Vistula River, adjacent to Aesti (further east).  About 800–900 years later the Aesti were named Old Prussians, who since AD 997 repeatedly successfully defended against take-over attempt by the newly created Duchy of the Polans.  The territory of the Old Prussians and neighboring Couronians and Livonians was unified politically in the 1230s as the Teutonic Order State.  Prussia was politically divided in the period 1466-1772, with western Prussia under protection of the crown of Poland-Lithuania and eastern Prussia a Polish fief until 1660.  The unity of both parts of Prussia remained preserved by retaining its borders, citizenship and authonomy until western and eastern Prussia were also politically re-united under the Kingdom of Prussia.  It is famous for many lakes, as well as forests and hills.  Since the military conquest by the Soviet Army in 1945 and the expulsion of the inhabitants it divided between northern Poland (most of the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship), Russia's Kaliningrad exclave, and southwestern Lithuania (Klaipėda Region).  The former German state of Prussia (1701–1947) derived its name from the region.

"Maquira
Maquira is a genus of trees in the Moraceae family, native to South America.

Tree
In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species.  In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height.  Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight.  Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old.  In looser definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees.  Trees have been in existence for 370 million years.  It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.

"Viennese trichord
In music theory, a Viennese trichord (also Viennese fourth chord and tritone-fourth chord), named for the Second Viennese School, is prime form <0,1,6>.  It has Forte # 3-5.

Second Viennese School
The Second Viennese School (German: Zweite Wiener Schule, Neue Wiener Schule ) is the group of composers that comprised Arnold Schoenberg and his pupils and close associates in early 20th century Vienna, where he lived and taught, sporadically, between 1903 and 1925.  Their music was initially characterized by late-Romantic expanded tonality and later, following Schoenberg's own evolution, a totally chromatic expressionism without firm tonal centre, often referred to as atonality; and later still, Schoenberg's serial twelve-tone technique.  Though this common development took place, it neither followed a common time-line nor a cooperative path.  Likewise, it was not a direct result of Schoenberg's teaching—which, as his various published textbooks demonstrate, was highly traditional and conservative.  Schoenberg's textbooks also reveal that the Second Viennese School spawned not from the development of his serial method, but rather from the influence of his creative example.

"Ringed seals and climate change
Ringed seals are the smallest and most abundant member of the seal family that live in the Arctic and Sub-Arctic regions.  The average life span of a ringed seal is 40 years, with a diet based mainly on Arctic cod and planktonic crustaceans.  Typically about 5 ft long, the ringed seal is known to be solitary with their main predator being polar bears. Recently, however, the biggest predator to ringed seals has been the changing temperature in the Arctic and the detrimental changes to sea ice that follow.  With declines in snowpack and sea ice due to warming ocean and atmospheric temperatures, survival has become tougher for ringed seals in the Arctic and Sub-Arctic regions.  Yet ringed seals are also potentially projected to thrive due to warming, considering the early extinction of their predators.  Climate change is sure to change the fate of all ringed seals in the coming years for better or worse.

Arctic
