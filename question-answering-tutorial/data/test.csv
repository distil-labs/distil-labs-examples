What was the title of the man who Sir Thomas Hungerford made his fortune working as a steward to?,1st Duke of Lancaster,"Farleigh Hungerford Castle
Farleigh Hungerford Castle, sometimes called Farleigh Castle or Farley Castle, is a medieval castle in Farleigh Hungerford, Somerset, England.

The castle was built to a quadrangular design, already slightly old-fashioned, on the site of an existing manor house overlooking the River Frome.  A park was attached to the castle, requiring the destruction of a local village.  His son, Sir Walter Hungerford, a successful knight and courtier to Henry V, became rich during the Hundred Years War with France and extended the castle with an additional, outer court, enclosing the parish church in the process.  By Walter's death in 1449, the substantial castle was richly appointed and its chapel decorated with murals.

He was called ""John of Gaunt"" because he was born in Ghent, then rendered in English as ""Gaunt"".

""Goldilocks and the Three Bears"" and the older still ""The Story of the Three Bears"" are two variations of a 19th-century fairy tale.

She sits in their chairs, eats some of their porridge, and falls asleep in one of their beds.  When the bears return and discover her, she starts up, jumps from the window, and is never seen again.  The other major version brings Goldilocks to the tale (replacing the old woman), and an even later version retained Goldilocks, but has the three bachelor bears transformed into Papa, Mama, and Baby Bear.

"Whose native growing land is more south, Beech or Daviesia?",Daviesia,"Beech
Beech (""Fagus"") is a genus of deciduous trees in the family Fagaceae, native to temperate Europe, Asia and North America.  Recent classification systems of the genus recognize ten to thirteen species in two distinct subgenera, ""Engleriana"" and ""Fagus"".  The ""Engleriana"" subgenus is found only in East Asia, and is notably distinct from the ""Fagus"" subgenus in that these beeches are low-branching trees, often made up of several major trunks with yellowish bark.  Further differentiating characteristics include the whitish bloom on the underside of the leaves, the visible tertiary leaf veins, and a long, smooth cupule-peduncle. "" Fagus japonica"", ""Fagus engleriana"", and the species ""F. okamotoi"", proposed by the botanist Chung-Fu Shen in 1992, comprise this subgenus.  The better known ""Fagus"" subgenus beeches are high-branching with tall, stout trunks and smooth silver-grey bark.  This group includes ""Fagus sylvatica"", ""Fagus grandifolia"", ""Fagus crenata"", ""Fagus lucida"", ""Fagus longipetiolata"", and ""Fagus hayatae"".  The classification of the European beech, ""Fagus sylvatica"" is complex, with a variety of different names proposed for different species and subspecies within this region (for example ""Fagus taurica"", ""Fagus orientalis"", and ""Fagus moesica"").  Research suggests that beeches in Eurasia differentiated fairly late in evolutionary history, during the Miocene.  The populations in this area represent a range of often overlapping morphotypes, though genetic analysis does not clearly support separate species.

Daviesia
Daviesia, commonly known as Bitter-peas, is a large genus of flowering plants in the legume family.  They are native to Australia, with a center of diversity in western Australia.
