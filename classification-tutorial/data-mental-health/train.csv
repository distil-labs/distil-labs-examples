"180 on Health Concerns For a few months I had headaches several times a day and thought nothing of it. I mentioned it in passing to my husband who insisted I go to a doctor. Long story short, I was diagnosed with a pituitary tumor. Very easy treatment and no major concerns with it. 

The twist is the medicine I take for it has a side effect of increasing anxiety. For me this has manifested into Health Anxieties and 99.9% of the time at night when I’m trying to sleep. I’ll feel a pain in my leg or think I have an elevated heart rate or, or, or, etc. 

I hate that I’ve gone 180 from being so passive to now fearful or obsessive. Has anyone else had a diagnosis trigger their anxiety? ",anxiety
"Losing sleep over losing sleep I might have a stomach ulcer. Maybe, probably? I went to a doctor who said I might have an ulcer, but didn't do any tests. Two weeks later I went to an urgent care doctor because I had been up 30+ hours with discomfort and nausea. They did a blood test and said I was h. pylori negative, but I'd been on Prilosec for nearly two weeks and apparently that can affect the test outcome. Was told to keep taking the Prilosec. About a week later I went back to urgent care because I was still losing sleep over nausea. On three or four occasions I have woken up in the middle of the night overheated and needing to vomit, almost fainting in the process. I also have pretty consistent abdominal pain across the entirety of my abdomen, which worries me because Google says that I'd feel pain only in the middle. 

I have really bad anxiety and this health crisis has spiraled me into depression as well. I've changed my entire lifestyle in the last month over this--all I eat are carrots, potatoes, apples, peanut butter, and yogurt. All I drink is water. Everything I do I scrutinize and I'm horribly afraid something will happen to my supposed ulcer and I'll bleed out (especially since I'm away at college and hours from my family). Has anyone dealt with and been officially diagnosed with an ulcer? I'm seeing a specialist in two weeks to hopefully be diagnosed, but I'm having a hard time waiting and would like to know if anyone has experienced anything similar.",anxiety
Perineum feels hard after a bowel movement. Should I be worried? I’m a 24 y/o female with digestive issues. My doctor think it’s just diet/IBS causing my constipation and upset stomach. I recently had a BM that made a inner hemorrhoid (I assume) pop out. My doctor told me not to worry and gave the same advice. It’s gone back since then but I noticed after some BMs my perineum (gooch area) feels harder. I can still squish it and it doesn’t feel like there’s something underneath but it’s harder. ,anxiety
"How To Destroy Fear Before It Destroys You &gt; Fear is the number one inhibitor of taking successful actions; and it is the number one instigator for taking destructive actions.

I was just listening to [a podcast](http://www.borntoprosper.com/how-to-destroy-fear/?ap_id=amandahayward) by Shane Krider and wanted to share here because I think it's relevant to the sub and listening to the podcasts has helped me start taking control of my thoughts and given me more confidence overall. I'm doing all the basics for my anxiety - eating well, exercising, meditation, medication - but this seems to be the icing on the cake for me! Really enjoying it.

"should i force myself to talk when i am unable to? //vent, about work and conflict with friend + my issues // i was having a conversation with a close friend of mine about work settings because i will be having an internship soon. we talked about standard work things and tips, but then it lead to talking about my anxiety.

i asked, ""if i'm unable to speak because of anxiety, how do i communicate that to them?"" 'them' being my coworkers. for extra context, i think this is a common thing but just in case, my throat closes up to a degree that it becomes hard to and painful to breathe or speak. obviously i need to breathe, so i've learned to tough through it, and even so i was able to get an appointment with someone who may be able to help this issue. as for speaking, that can be even more painful than breathing, so i usually try to tap my throat with my finger and hold up one finger with the other hand to try to communicate that i need a minute and i can't breathe/speak.

i was worried that may not be enough, and i had previously told my friend about my issues. i figured he'd be the right guy to ask, especially since he's training to become a therapist. i guessed he may have some ideas i haven't thought about yet

he told me to tell my coworkers i need a minute to think and to maybe say it directly. i asked him, ""if i can't talk, how do i say it to them directly?"" i'm bad with conveying tone, partially because i'm autistic, so i can see in hindsight that it may have come off wrong.

he asked me if i was just going to leave or stay quiet without telling them what was going on, and he also said that the situation would just become worse. i was starting to get a bit upset and i said that i knew that. *then he told me to learn how to force myself to say it.*

that's where i became really upset. i have no idea if this was justified or not, all i know is how much it hurt. i tired my best to remind him of some of my tics, and how if i'm stressed enough to be unable to speak, forcing myself would DEFINATELY make the situation worse. i told him about how there's been times where i've gotten overwhelmed and anxious, which led to me accidently hitting someone rarely or most commonly myself. sometimes i'll have really bad ones which make me yell, fling my arm beside my head, or slam a fist down on a table.

i then apologized. he then told me that it's unfair, but i have to vocalize that kind of thing. i worked some things out with another close friend of mine, and we both agreed that i should maybe carry around some laminated cards on a ring with common words and sayings to help me communicate. we also talked about telling my coworkers and employers beforehand about my issues, and how i need a few minutes to myself to calm down.

i tried messaging the friend from before, saying that i wanted to talk. i apologized for getting upset and explained that i was hurt by what he said and that i was hoping we can talk about it all. i apologized again. i've seen he's read the message, but he hasn't responded. i'm a bit worried, but trying to be patient with out differing time zones.

should i force myself to talk when i am unable to, especially with some of my issues? i want to believe i'm not at fault, but i feel horrible about getting upset and i'm wondering if he's right and i should just try to suck it up.

**edit:** i also worry that i may have overreacted and blown up over something unimportant. it's just so infuriating and hurtful because i've been told all my life to force myself to do things and to just toughen up and deal with it. i've been called overly emotional and at this point any slight indication someone thinks that way kind of sets me off. i'm sorry if this doesn't make much sense, i struggle putting these things into words.",anxiety
"Struggle Bus ... I'm riding it today, maybe even driving it. No need to get into details, I'm just anxious for my health and a family member's health (I hate that I project my HA to other people, as if I didn't do enough worrying as is).

But I just wanted to write it out that today sucked and my worrying sucks and I hate it. I know I'm not alone when I come here, and for that I am grateful. Hoping tomorrow is a better day for me and anyone else riding the bus. ",anxiety
"'Ice-Pick Headaches / year long' Hey!

So I was wondering whether some of you could help me out. For the last year, I have been experiencing a weird sensation at the back/top of my head, the closest thing I can describe it to being an 'Ice-Pick Headache'. Originally, I was having it a few times a week, and I would get these sensations a few times a day, lasting only 2-5 seconds. However, this has now reduced to once a week on average. During the last year, I have been to the doctors about this issue a few times, mentioning the almost 'pinching' sensation that occurs. However, on none of these occasions have any follow-up appointments been scheduled, each doctor suggesting there is absolutely nothing to worry about and suggesting they could be a symptom of anxiety or tension. For a few months, it hasn't worried me as much but has been in the back of my head (quite literally!), and I decided to make another appointment for today. Again, I was told the same thing, but was prescribed with an anti-inflammatory medicine.

Have any of you experienced similar symptoms, and do you have any advice?

fyi, 21 year old male who has never had real issues with headaches/migraines.

Much appreciated.",anxiety
"Should I see a neurologist? I am 19,F and have GAD btw

"Struggling with fear of breast cancer after seeing multiple doctors. Feeling lost. Hello everyone! This sub has been a great source of comfort for me for quite some time now. I have never felt the need to post until today as the last month has been very hard on me and I'm hoping someone will have some ideas on how I can combat my extreme health anxiety.

As a preface, I’m a 24 year old woman.

About a month ago, I felt a giant white welt under my left breast. The next day, it was no longer raised completely, but there was a slight bump like a pimple or a bug bite, but there was no 'peak'. It was red in the area, about the size of a quarter. No pain, no itching. I don't think I would have noticed it if I hadn't felt it. I have always struggled with health anxiety but for the past 6 months it has been pretty dormant. Then I googled 'bug bite on breast' and everything spiraled from there.

I stumbled upon Inflammatory Breast Cancer and am now convinced that I have it. I read multiple stories about how it is commonly misdiagnosed as a bug-bite (my doctor said it was a bug bite when I went in). This made my anxiety worse. So I saw another doctor at the family practice I go to. She wasn't sure what it was, it could be a pimple/skin irritation, and told me if it was still there in 2 weeks she would send me to a breast specialist.

I made an appointment with a breast specialist on my own because I could not bear the wait. He looked at it and told me it is most likely just a skin irritation from my bra or a clogged pore that is taking a while to heal. Said if it didn't go away in another 2-3 weeks that he would send me for an ultrasound but he really didn’t think it was anything to worry about.

Again, this was not enough for me. I made an appointment with my OBGYN and he looked at it and echoed the same sentiment the other doctors did. It is nothing, whatever it was is on its way to healing. But he would send me for an ultrasound to set my mind at ease.

I got the ultrasound yesterday and they didn’t find anything. They said there is a chance it was a tiny cyst that is now almost gone that it is undetectable on the machine. This should have made me feel better but I read online that IBC is very hard to detect on ultrasounds. If it didn’t go away in two weeks, the radiologist told me I should see a dermatologist because it seems to be more of a skin issue. 

That day, I called to make an appointment with a derm because I know it takes time to get in to see them. Funnily enough, they had a cancellation that day and asked if I wanted to come in that afternoon. Of course, I said yes. 

When I was there, I explained my issues. The derm looked at it and again, said the same thing everyone else did. It’s most likely just a skin irritation and she gave me the option of waiting to see if it goes away on its own within 2-3 months or she could do a shave biopsy. I, of course, opted for the biopsy.

Then I got home and did more research and found out IBC is usually only diagnosed through a punch biopsy. The biopsy I got at the derm will not be deep enough to diagnose that even if it is there.

I cannot catch my breath and am struggling to function like a normal human being. It’s much more likely that the spot under my breast is just what everyone says it is; an irritation!!! IBC is SO rare, especially for someone my age, but it’s the deadliness of the disease that is haunting my every move. I am so terrified of death and of dying young and leaving behind everyone I love.

I am on 10mg Buspar and have been for only a month now. The side effects are crippling me. I am only sleeping 3-4 hours a night, I’m having horrible nightmares, dizziness, headaches. I am not eating and have lost 15 pounds this month because of it. I cry hysterically almost every night. I obsessively check my boobs, whether that is starting at them in the mirror or prodding them or comparing them (the left one is bigger than the right, always has been – but my health anxiety makes me wonder if it really has always been this way).

Every new spot I discover or mark or freckle sends me into extreme panic. I’m struggling to meet deadlines at work. I’m letting my house go to shit. 


 I just started therapy last week so I am hoping that eventually starts to kick in and help as well.

I guess what I’m looking for is advice on how to calm my nerves. How to function like a normal human being. I’m so depressed. I’m missing out on so much. 

Any words of advice would be so appreciated.

"Should I get my own apartment? (currently living with parents) Hi guys,

I am currently apartment hunting with the approval of my step-father who has agreed to help pay for an apartment of my own while I wait for disability benefits. I think it would be very helpful and therapeutic for me if I created my own space that I deemed to be sacred and worth my time. One of the fears that I have is that I would feel alone in this apartment, and fall into depression and anxiety. Maybe my meds will help with that. Also I have anxiety about needing to go out and get groceries on a weekly basis. But maybe this would be good for me and I would be able to hit up the natural food stores. I also would choose not to bring my cat with me (who is very therapeutic and supportive) because she is happy here at this home. But I won't have her around. Maybe I could get a small fish aquarium. Also I would have space for some small fitness equipment, like a kettle bell and barbell. Well I hope that if I do get an apartment it will be a good decision. I just don't want to be alone and depressed. But I am sure that is normal for many of us who live alone. We just have to make sure we have a solid routine of having activities to do outside the house and around people. ",bipolar

"Delusion or just incredibly elevated anxiety? Hi everybody. Last year I was diagnosed as type 2 because I haven’t experienced what I considered to be full blown mania—only hypo, and I’m extremely prone to severe depressed “lows.” 

However, I’ve been wondering a lot lately whether or not I’m just experiencing an intense level of anxiety/insecurity or if this crosses into the area of what would be considered a delusion. I haven’t had any of the more obvious signs of delusions that I’ve read about on here (i.e. thinking I’m God or somebody else or an informant, etc.), but I most definitely feel all the time like I can tell 95-100% exactly what people are thinking about me to the point that it hinders me from functioning in many instances. For example, I will literally coup myself up in my room for days/weeks because I feel like I absolutely know exactly what my roommates or friends/family/professors are thinking of me in these high and low emotional states and I don’t want to even confront them for this reason. I’ve even accused my mom of basically “thinking her thoughts” too loud at me or even lashing out when I think she’s judging me or thinking something extremely negative. She’ll obviously say things like I’m assuming way too much and I have no clue what I’m talking about and I still don’t believe her. 
 
I know logically when I think about this that it’s ridiculous but part of me also lets it affect me to the point that I will hide myself or freak out about it. The fact that I’m partially able to understand that this obviously isn’t the true case is what dissuades me from calling it a delusion, but it’s also so strong of a fear and “observation” that it makes me wonder. What do you think? Has anybody else experienced anything this? ",bipolar
"Relative challenging me over my meds. I was speaking to a close relative the other day and when I said I was feeling a bit grotty he preceded to say it is 'those pills' I am on that is causing my problems and that I should try and stop taking them. He is going through a hard time at present so I didn't try to defend my mental health care plan to him apart from saying how dangerous it is to come off the drugs especially cold turkey. Yet he watches a lot of Yt videos about vaccines and psyche meds and how they are bad or so they say. He has fallen for it. It is as if taking a pill for your brain is unacceptable, but if it was antibiotics he would say in the same sincere manner 'you must take the full course' etc. My brother is the same. He once said to me I shouldn't be proud to take medication. I mean if I can't convince my own family that I need lithium, aripiprazole etc to function than what chance do I have outside of this setting. ",bipolar
"I Think My BP Is Getting Worse Hi... I really need a space to express myself right now. I have had a BP diagnosis for just over 8 years. I was diagnosed at 18, and I stayed medicated until I was 22. However, when I was 22 I ended up homeless due to a conflict with my mother. I was having trouble getting my medication at the time, so I eventually talked to my doctor about weaning myself off my medication. He agreed that I was handling my symptoms very well, and that we could give it a shot. All was very well for the next unmedicated 3.5 years.

However, just this year, I've been going through some noticeable changes. Starting about 6 months ago, I settled into hypomania and dealt with it rather well. However, that hypomania, for the first time ever, developed into mania. I am currently enjoying the worst depressive episode I have ever had in my life - but I'm thinking it's a mixed episode because I am also irritable and experiencing impulse control issues. 

I've heard that bipolar can become more intense as you age, but I really didn't see this coming. I thought I was one of ""the lucky ones"" whose symptoms weren't severe enough to necessitate treatment and that I could use all the tools I learned in my many years of inpatient and outpatient therapy to stay on track. I do have an intake appointment for a local psychiatric care group lined up, but, for the first time, my symptoms are so bad that I'm having trouble working and doing day-to-day tasks. I have also noticed a lapse in memory, which really scares me. I can't bear to be around people because I don't want them to see me like this. And I'm scared I'll lash out at them before I can think twice. 

I know that I will ride this out. I know that everything that goes up will eventually go down and back up again. But right now, I would help to know that I'm not completely alone in this.",bipolar
Feeling down Hey y’all first time poster long time reader. Just wanted to post and get some advice. I was diagnosed as bipolar type 1 a year ago.

nightmare related to my bipolar disorder I have been extremely manic the past week or so and a few nights ago I experienced a nightmare that really irked me. I get weird dreams and nightmares quite a lot but this one was extremely unsettling. It started off with me walking down a street in the city I live in and I could see something up ahead so I started walking towards it. When I got close enough I saw a person with a bag over their head being held in handcuffs by two men and was wearing a nightgown of some sort with “BIPOLAR” written across it. They were knocking door to door telling people to stay away from people with bipolar disorder and that they’re freaks. I started running down the street and I passed two children in a window sewing dolls (not sure what that was about but pretty creepy) and after that I woke up. Overall it was a horrifying dream and I would like to know if anyone else with bipolar disorder has had a nightmare similar to that. ,bipolar

"My mother (50F) has been living in the apartment (that she and my father owns) for 2 years. The apartment is definitely a downgrade from the last apartment (rented) we lived in 2 years ago. It was in a more posh and quiet area while this is in the outskirts near a highway. However, this has all the amenities and is in no way a bad place to live in.My mother has always complained a bit about the sounds of vehicles and how hot it gets in the summer in this apartment because we stay on the top floor however, for the past 2 months she has become incredibly irritated with it. She cries about how much she hates it and how much she regrets buying the apartment. We have air-conditioned it for her comfort but she still gets anxious about anything and everything. She was recently diagnosed with very high levels of Thyroid and she has been suffering from insomnia and fever every day for the past few months which can explain a lot of the discomfort but it seems like she will not find peace until we move which is not feasible for us and she knows it and becomes more regretful for complaining.I think my mother misses our last apartment because it was bigger and the whole family (me, my brother, my father, and my mother) lived together there. She knows I will have to leave once I get a job and unlike some of her friends whose children are home due to the pandemic, my brother still works and lives in a different city although he is working from home there. Recently I and my parents visited him and stayed at his place for about a week my mother really liked the fact that we all were together for a week and she said she felt because of the cooler weather in his city even though his home was a mess. She was dreading coming back home and now that she is home, I see her shaking and crying. I have tried to talk to her but she tells me that I will not understand what she is going through and it was her mistake that she agreed to move to this apartment in the first place. My dad and I do not know what to do anymore. We cannot move because of money issues.Could it be depression? I do not think she is open to get professional help so is there any way I and my family could help? Is she associating her home with bad memories? We used to move every 2 to 5 years because of my dad's job so is that a way she has been coping with bad memories for the last 25 years and now she cannot because my dad has retired and this is supposed to be her permanent home? My mother hates the apartment she lives in. Is it because of depression?",depression

I don’t care about relationships. I’ve never had a crush. I don’t like talking to people. The closer I get to someone the more I want to run away from them. All of my conversations are surface level, just the bare minimum to reach what’s socially acceptable.

"Its a blessing and a curse. And I do not know if it comes from meds or from depression itself, but lately I have that feeling where nothing bothers me at all because I hardly care. This is great when I am facing a situation that would normally make me spiral.

"He doesnt seem bothered about calling me or meeting me unless I initiate. We dont talk for very long as he still lives with his parents and is apparently always ""busy"" helping his mum.
