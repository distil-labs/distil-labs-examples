# Problem setting

Imagine you work for a mental health organization developing an automated screening system to analyze text comments for potential indicators of mental health conditions. In such a system, improving classification accuracy helps identify individuals who might need support, enabling faster intervention and better resource allocation - critical factors in mental healthcare delivery.

We will base our example on a [mental health dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suchintikasarkar/sentiment-analysis-for-mental-health) containing user comments and their corresponding mental health classifications across four categories:

- Normal
- Depression
- Anxiety
- Bipolar

The dataset consists of text comments and their associated mental health labels, with special consideration given to privacy protection and ethical handling of sensitive personal information.
