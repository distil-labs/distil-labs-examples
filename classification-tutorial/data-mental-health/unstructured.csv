i don t know if this is the right place to write this but before quarantine 0 9 i just thought i wa an introvert and just a very organized and methodic person but then on quarantine i started to realize that i seem to get a lot more anxious than most people and always keep thinking about stuff that happened a second ago always think about what someone s thinking about me if i did or said something wrong always think about everything that can go wrong everywhere i go memorizing the menu a week before etc and i thought the problem for a big part of the anxiety wa online class and being stuck at home with my parent they re nice tho so when i finally got to go do an exchange semester abroad i get to be outside all the time i meet new people gt the freaking anxiety is still here and that make me think that nothing is gon na make it go away but i need it to go away cause i feel like i am an introvert but i make one wrong move i just go from quiet introvert to weird and lose all the people i met i mean met that s really the right word because i just can t seem to do the right thing i don t know some of my roommate that got here the same week a me go out every night with friend and i m just stuck at the same awkward convo phase and it s not like that i scared to talk to people or i don t like talking to people i do it s just when i come back home i start to rethink every single word that i said and blame myself for the smalled little mistake i m just really lost sometimes i think what i do how i think is normal but then it doesn t i didn t even know what anxiety wa until a year or so ago so
what is the point of living life suck life is hard 90 of the time the 0 that doesn t suck doesn t make up for the other 90 people say that i need to just keep on living because they would miss me they re selfish what about what i want i just want to blink out of existence before anyone start feeling like a knight in shining armor i know i m loved i know i m not alone i m know i m smart and valuable i know all the thing but none of those thing make up for the fact that i simply don t want to be here anymore
i suppose i ll live one more month the thing that is keeping me alive is my favourite music group and now they are participating in a show and i want to see it ending because this group s music kept me alive since 0 also i ll see my brother birthday but i think that is my maximum at this point i m really glad that some people supported me even that they know me only because of my reddit post and i got more attention and support than from my ex friend through last year i hope that everyone will be happy i will continue telling everyone that suicide is the worst decision but i cant tell it to myself not anymore my close friend could have died yesterday the bomb exploded km away from her and she is still in danger i don t know what i would do without her i m always thinking of everyone else but me and i ll keep doing it i think i don t deserve to be saved actually i don t want to struggle anymore i ve got so much pain that i couldn t even put it all in 00000 word even if i ll try to live i m sure i will be suffering just even more i have so little light in my life i don t deserve to be loved i always make thing worse i m sure that everyone will be happier without me that they won t have to talk with me and my parent won t have to spend money on my university idk maybe it s just my stpd schyzotypical personal disorder i dont know i don t think i know anything i don t know what is happening around me i i m tired and i m sorry to everyone who had to read this i m so sorry

MOMENTO COMO QUE EL JYP SE MURI0?
Suddenly I feel grateful that my low school was not a public school
"People keep saying if you want to be happy, you can be happy! Well, I want to be happy, but what should I do first? Because doing anything, going anywhere only feels it adds more weight on the sadness and depression. I feel safest to hide in my bed. I just slept 20 hours today and still feel tired"
i just can t people and the thought of how i am uninteresting and awkward in social situation make me sick
"Hi, I am a 29 yrs old man, I am married with a wonderful woman and we have a little girl. The problem is that I feel depressed, I started with some ideas that maybe I am not good enough. I see my body on the mirror and I do not like it (Including sexual aspects), I think that I am not the best economic provider for my family, and all this get me to think that I am so immature and maybe my wife will be disappointed. I am scared that maybe she miss somebody else, maybe she thinks about somebody else from her past, some stuff like that. I have even compared myself in those ideas, even without having met anyone from her past, as stupid as it sounds. She has never say anything about that, nor has acting like that, never. She know some of this and try to support me. I never felt like this in the previous years, this started about three months ago and it is a hell that tortures me every day, since it causes me to think all the time about ideas, to think that there is something more, to overthink details than in they are not really like that.I am conscious that the problem is me, with this insecurity, with this ridiculous ideas, but I do not know how to deal with them. I know that I have to go to therapy, and I am actually looking for some therapist on my city, but I wish to know if there is a way to block all these ideas in day to day. I just want to stop all of this because I do not want it to scale on something else, I do not want to affect my marriage, and I want to be plenty for me and my loved ones. Insecurity issues"
"(Trigger Warning) Does anyone else get an anxiety attack when… Is it just me? Anyone have advice on how to manage/ treat? Does anyone else have anxiety attacks over small things of repetitive nature? Like for example I can have a full on attack when my bf picks or pulls at his beard. Or when someone is tapping their fingers or legs. It seems like I get triggered by other people’s coping mechanisms. 

This has been extremely frustrating because my bf has this habit when he is anxious and not even realizing it and it’s causing my to have attacks and then I am zorped and on edge. And he is constantly on edge trying to look out for me. 

We are trying different things like closing doors, and both trying to be mindful but I would really like help on how to manage and treat it. Does anyone else share a similar experience? 

I am also currently in therapy and working on it but she doesn’t have any experience with this and am beginning to give up."
"TLDR: **What type of lay-out do you have in your apartment / house that you find helps lift your mood?** **Vs what type of lay-out do you find is not helpful for your moods?**Thanks for any answers! I use my computer in a loft With a large chair that folds out to a bed. There is this nagging sensation that laying down in a loft while using the computer (Playing games / reddit whatever) is actually contributing to my worse moods. What to hear from others.

"My college is keeping tabs on me and it's making me anxious... I'm a business student at a local college. Last semester  I found out, that one of my classmates or professors had anonymously reported me to the school for strange behavior of some kind (my meds give me hypoglycemia which can make me slur words or seem tired).

Since getting that email, I've never had social anxiety so badly. It feels like I'm one careless comment away from a hospital stay. I dont know who reported me or even why. I suspect everyone but simultaneously feel like it's all in my imagination. I had to leave class today because I felt everybody's eyes on me. It feels like the well is poisoned. I'm not sure exactly what to do at this point.

"Apparently my ""resolved"" trauma is nothing more than varying depths of buried emotional landmines. People (sometimes even me) blindly trip them and explode clearly unresolved past traumas and I am back to square one. I thought I was finally making progress to be proud of only to be left still so fragile feeling. I hate it. And I guess I do not know the difference between accepting and healing my past vs just ignoring it for a long as I can. Coping mechanism"
"Hey...28 Year Old Male here..I just feel so tired and confused. 13 Years with Major Depression and it is basically sapped my energy away to the point of never having 1 day where I do not feel tired. Constantly laying in bed, trying to get out of it only to fall right back into it.. Insomnia and Excessive Sleepiness haunt my life..At work, it is not any better...I do a Laborious Job and constantly feeling drained of energy while on the job makes me feel like I am not enough despite there being older people than me there who do not really feel tired...I have a constant feeling of disassociation, feeling like I do not belong in my own body...like my mind has been only added to it...I constantly see shadows or things that are not there and it is driving me insane sometimes..I constantly forget things when it is just been told to me and I hate it! I feel so..stupid for not remembering anything...I try so hard to remember what I just forgot, but it never comes back...I cannot even remember special things unless it is in writing...I feel like I am combatting myself.. Like I have two different personalities mixed into one. My personality before depression when I was a Teenager as a Freshman in High School and after depression hit... there is the Empathetic, Helpful, Patient side and then there is the Depressive Side where I am prone to being numb, very irritated, easy to anger, and just plain not caring about myself. it is...making me feel so...disconnected.I feel so bad when I get very irritated and mad at my Mom for not understanding my depression and just needing help on the same things I tell her about...she is forgetful sometimes and she needs time to understand...it is not her fault...I feel like a bad son sometimes...Then there is the heavy guilt and anxiety...I feel like I cannot control it even with the Medication I am taking...I feel like such a mess that nobody should be bothering with..All of this just makes me feel so disconnected from people...I want to be alone...but I do not at the same time... it is like my mind does not know what it wants anymore...I cannot even play MMORPGs and other genres of games I enjoy without feeling like I want to drop them as fast I got into them. it is so stressful and annoying...Even though I have a Job, a Loving Relationship of 5 Years, Family Members that I guess still care about me..I do not even care about myself. I still do not know what it means be truly happy...it never lasts..I always have to put up a Facade to avoid having to explain myself or worry people..I only recently found out what this is.. ""Smiling Depression"" I always one day hope I will not have to act like I am completely fine and stable, but everyday that hope dwindles till only nothing is left.. I feel like I should not exist. Sorry for ranting and getting how I feel off my chest...I should not be bothering anyone with this and should just suffer with it on my own... I hate myself, I do not know who I am anymore, I feel broken because I do not feel true happiness and I feel alone.."

"I feel like the people that I love most in my life do not need me or want me. I feel so alone. I am exhausted from the stress, and I do not feel like I can talk to anybody about it because Ill be a burden by talking about myself and my feelings. I feel that the ones who mean the most to me can manage and do not need me. Nobody gives a shit if I am really okay or not. As long as I look it and get out of bed and go to work then I must be fine. This loneliness really really sucks. I hate crying, and I really need a hug. Just feel like nobody gives a shit about me"
"Scrambling &amp; struggling to cope... Hello! I'm new to Reddit in general and I'm really happy that this is a thing! I have been struggling to cope lately (Bipolar II and anxiety)  and not a damn thing makes me feel better. I am in this constant state of emotional discomfort that manifests to the physical. I want to be left completely alone so I don't have to worry about the toll taken on myself and the people I love. I'm so focused on pushing people away I feel like I don't love anyone anymore...at least for right now. I try to avoid any sort of affection and I just feel like such an awful, horrid person. My boyfriend is so supportive and I feel so guilty and angry with him for trying to help me because I'm tired of the help and I just want to give up. I've felt like a ghost for a while now, why not be an actual ghost? My boyfriend just got his concealed carry permit and I just wish he could kill me. I can't live with myself like this for much longer...and I don't want to try to cope with this on my birthday in 4 days.

Can anyone offer any feedback or perhaps share their own experiences? Thank you all so much for reading."

"the only reason i have not killed myself is because i believe there is nothing after death and I am afraid that it will not be any sort of peace since you have to exist to feel peace and I am terrified that the last thing I feel will be what i feel for eternity. but all i think about is suicide. I have zero passion or motivation, my brain is a constant fog, i cannot even force myself to move my body half the time, if it were not for my parents i would be homeless in a ditch somewhere. i cut off all my friends and isolated myself, the idea of being around people is unpleasant to the point of excruciating. And terrifying. I am too anxious to be around anyone. I have been self isolated for almost 2 years and I have forgotten how to socialize. I use alcohol sometimes when I am desperate to combat it but now it just makes me feel overall worse. I lost all my creativity. I am too anxious to talk to anyone. I just had an insane freak out outburst of sorts and my dad tried to fight me then all but disowned me. I could not control it and i never can. I feel nothing but guilt, shame, misery, hopelessness and nothingness 24/7. Nothing else. My default is utter despair. I genuinely would be dead if I was not more scared of death than i am a life of torture. Even if it were literal physical torture constantly I would still be too afraid to end it. But I am pretty much already dead. I may as well be. I am a ghost. I cry all the time and when I am not crying its just because I am too empty to. I feel like my brain and my life is ruined. I have sabotaged myself and my relationships and the flicker of a life i almost had because I am weak, pathetic and something in me is fundamentally broken. I just want to die. I cannot focus on anything ever. I get the most rapid mood swings from empty to sad to bored to rage. I get addicted to and abuse any substance I try. I cannot do anything. I shower once every few months. I am posting this so i can focus on something instead of staring at a wall and crying. I do not know why. I know nobody gives a shit. because I sure do not. Fuck it i might as well be dead"

"Take care of the mood, ojo lali little bottle"
it s not easy being useless i am honestly just considering quitting my job and spending these last few day in a hedonistic fashion i hate my family so their feeling don t matter i never understood the logic that i shouldn t kill myself because it would make other people sad it seems like everyone is for doing what s best for you until that thing that s best for you is suicide the rule for suicide are different because when you re suicidal you have to throw what s best for you out the window and do what other people want for you and that s fucking bullshit
"I have OCD and depression and whenever I am in a depressive episode (which has been for the last 6 months) it seems like my obsessions will never cease and they will not stop. Is there anything I can do to make this better, if my depression is actually the culprit to my worsening OCD? Can depression make OCD worse?"
"Basically the title but a little background story for context.So it all probably started in middle school when I was bullied in school and developed severe anxiety, social anxiety and just a general feelings of worthlessness and inferiority. Then I went on to high school and I was bullied again so I decided to transfer because I believed it would be different but it was not so I transferred again a year later, again thinking it would be different but I was bullied again. But all the transferring caused me to finish high school 2 years later (because where I live - in Europe - if you transfer you have to start as a freshman again). So I graduated 2 years later - last year at 21 and started college but I got covid during my exam season and I was sick for 2ish months I could not get out of bed and I was not able to study for any of my exams so I just dropped out. I have been feeling really depressed ever since so I applied to a different college and Ill be starting in fall but Ill be 23 then. It did not really matter to me that much before but now that I have been seeing many people my age graduating lately, it kind of hit me that my peers are graduating and Ill only be starting now. It made me feel even more like a failure than before. I keep blaming and hating myself for transferring so many times in high school and for dropping out of college and everything. Why do I keep making all these stupid decisions??!! Now I am going to have to be in class with 18 year olds and Ill feel like the odd weird old one. :( I am considering not even going and just giving up on everything completely at this point. :( But I also feel like that might make me feel even more like a failure so idk what is worse. :( Damn I wish I could just go back in time and never make those stupid life choices. :( I am starting college at 23 and I feel like a complete failure."
"I have spent the last two years at a real low. I had everything under control, my life was organized and I really put in the work to finish my trade school with the best grades I could manage. Then I did not find work, even though I was sure that I have something to contribute, employers did not like the look of a long-term-depression CV. But I kept at it, sent applications, tried to get the good habits going again, exercising every day and was really at a good upturn. I was so confident I would break out of that ~1year of intense depression. Then I had an accident that made me incapable of walking for a few weeks and definitely not exercise for longer. I was scared, but I was determined, I had support from my family. Then my father suddenly died. Just like that and it tore me apart. Since then it was really bad. I could not put anything together for some months, but I always knew I can do it. I have done it before and it was so good to feel happy and content. After a while I did some minimum wage work to try and get a schedule going that helps me get it together again. That work was horrible though and working there did not help me at all. But it did motivate me to try even harder to work in my trade and I actually managed to find a job that is perfect. Everything I wanted and people really appreciated me for the work I do. I struggled but in the past month I have already changed a lot and I am just picking up the pace. Today I was fired because the company is about to be broke. I really do not want to crash over this, but I am scared. Unemployment is bad for me. Anyway, thanks for reading my rant. I will keep working on it and do my best not to drown in this. It is such a struggle"

"Everyday that I am not high I honestly struggle to find a reason to keep going. Everything about my life sucks and I have no one to blame but myself.I recently graduated college, which I only attended because I did not know what else to do with my life. The last few weeks of school I was such a wreck that anytime I was not high was spent crying uncontrollably and, at one point, cutting off all my hair. A few weeks later I quit the only job I managed to get. It was across the country and I had no idea what I was doing and had no access to weed to damper my depression and self-hate. Now I am back home, sharing a room with my brother who is ten years younger than me (It was either that or sharing a room with my three sisters). And everyday I realize how much of a bother I am. My siblings should not have to worry about some dead beat 22 year old taking up their resources. My mom should not have to drive me to work because I was too stupid to get a license in college.So my days are spent high or at my minimum wage job as a fast food cashier. At nights, if I am lucky, I get to hang out with a guy who only suffers through my presence when he wants someone easy to f*ck. 90% of the time tho, I am just laying in bed staring at the wall wondering why I do not just give up already.I literally hate myself so much. Why am I the way that I am. Why cannot I be better. Sometimes I wish I could just claw myself out of my skin and stop being me. My Life is a Joke"

Hey everyone this is my second Post.I am a 20 year old male. My ex girlfriend who i loved very much and would have spent all my life with her. Left me 3 months ago. And moved on just one month after our 7 month relationship. I tried replacing her with other women but i just cannot. I tried new hobbies new anything. I have 0 friends and this is not a topic i can Talk to anybody with really. The pain kills me that she is happy with someone else. I always wish i could turn back time and maybe make her stay. I feel like There is no way out. The pain kills me almost everyday. What worsens it is that we live in the same village. My very first girlfriend cheated on my too. So my trust issues are through the roof with anyone. I am miserable. I have not talked or texted her ever since the breakup. I just wish the pain would be gone and i could move on. it is not that i could not have anyone else. I consider myself pretty good with women. But i just cannot seem to let go. have not talked to her ever since the breakup. I am dying inside. And i think I am going crazy.Peace and Love I feel like There is no way escaping the pain
violetscruk yeah off aberdeen on the miller platform the one the chopper left before it went down thew other day
First time posting here. There is so much on my mind. I just cannot find it in me to think I am worthy of anything. I work myself to the bone and get very little appreciation. Its really been taking a toll on me. I used to love what I do and now I feel like I am just taking advantage of. I have never been a fan of my appearance. Physical I have been overweight my whole life and recently been trying to change that but with the work I am putting in I feel like it does not make a difference. I just want to feel happy about myself but I just cannot seem to find anything to be happy about. Only thing that makes me smile anymore is my 3 kids. They are about the only people that make me fee appreciate in some way. That being said they usually want mom over me but I understand that. I am just been feeling worthless and I cannot seem to get myself out of the ditch of sadness. Thanks for reading and I appreciate any help given. How to find self worth?
"Thoughts on Abilify? Hey all, quick question. I saw my psychiatrist this afternoon and he suggested going on Abilify if my anxiety and paranoia don't subside soon. Just trying to weigh the costs and benefits here. I do really need the anxiety to decrease so I can function at work, but my paranoia isn't *that* bad right now. I'm also already feeling tired, foggy and sluggish, and I know that antipsychotics exacerbates tiredness, fogginess and sluggishness even in small doses.  

Anyone here have good experiences with this drug? Bad experiences? Thank you for your input!"
misselizabeth food allergy suck i became allergic to shellfish about month ago out of the blue and i used to love shrimp
"Possibly losing parenting rights due to bipolar disorder The most recent manic episode I had was after being depressed and diagnosed with major depressive disorder to be prescribed Zoloft. Within 6 weeks I was staying up for 9 days and delusional. I thought my partner was going to kill me so I called 911. The police arrived and I was very agitated and explained my delusions and they took me to the nearest psych ward for an evaluation. Unfortunately, that psych ward didn’t keep me long enough despite my volunteering to stay longer. They also gave me a medication I ended up allergic to which took treatment even longer.

This resulted in asking my in-laws who live in a different state miles away to help me care for my daughter until I found the right medication combination and was stable. I knew it could take a few months and I had no one else available local to me. The only way my inlaws would take my daughter is if I signed over guardianship. I was under the impression it would only be for a year at the most. But honestly, I wasn’t really in the right mind to consent to that paperwork. I just knew I needed help and I did what I could to ensure my daughter had the best care possible while I got stable. 

Fast forward to now my partner and I petitioned the courts to end guardianship as I have been stable for 2 years. I have letters from my therapist and pdoc stating I am in treatment and stable and medication compliant. 

Well, my in-laws are trying to prove I am unfit for things I did while I was manic so they can adopt my daughter without my consent or permission through the courts. They're also trying to prove that my partner (their child) is unfit I am less worried about that. 

My therapist says they're on a witch hunt and that they're just trying to raddle me and no judge would grant them adoption. I hope she's right. 

I just wanted to share what I am going through because 1. support would be nice. and 2. if anyone else is going through this you aren't alone."
"What I do in life is constantly find distractions (like what I am doing now posting here venting) and when distractions ran out and I am left alone with ny thoughts, I look back and notice how I am barely scratching the surface of living a satisfactory life.It feels like I am just waiting to die. It hurts everywhere. I am so fucking unhappy it hurts"

"Does anyone else feel like you are never going to be happy? I have been depressed most of my life, over the last year and half I have been on an antidepressant. Its helped my anxiety but I am not necessarily happy, just numb. Is this as good as it gets? I was talking to my doctor earlier trying to explain to him that I do not feel good and I have not for a long time and maybe we should switch antidepressants because I do not think this one is helping (and causing weight gain, fatigue, exhaustion, etc) and he was just like nope you are fine and completely ignored my concerns. Does it ever get better or am I just destined to be miserable for the rest of my life Worried I am never going to be happy"

"I do not want to talk to anyone, and I do not have the energy to anyway. All I want to do is go be depressed in bed, watch something, scroll my phone endlessly. But I have a puppy to take care of and she is just full of energy. It makes me feel worse that I cannot just be happy with her.Right now it feels like just after we (my partner and I) recover from one thing something else knocks us down. Like legit we were behind on bills for a month or two. We only just recover from that and as we are talking about getting kitchen appliances, our puppy desexed, maybe have a date night, we get fucking curb stomped and we are left without transport and will be dealing with this shit for the next month. We probably will not have any money for the next month and a half. Like living off noodles idk if we will be able to pay our rent no money.it is just one fucking thing after the other and it is been this way for years. I am so fucking beyond depressed and miserable. What the fuck is the point of life if it is just a constant struggle. Is this fucking normal? Is this what life is like for everyone? I am so fucking sick of it. When does shit get to level out and be okay? It feels like I am never going to get better and I am going to be miserable for the rest of my pathetic life. What are you even meant to do when you are having a horrible day and you just have no energy to talk to anyone?"
"Left thigh pain/tingle/numbness Since I was 19 (29 now) I have had tingling and numbness in my upper left thigh/leg. When I was 19 I went to the Dr, he picked up my leg patted it and said looks like a healthy 19 year old leg to me. I am starting to get concerned because the pain has been getting more severe and I am worried it is something major. Anyone else experience this?"

let me start by saying i am in the same boat a all of you i wish i could help you all but i can t sadly about me when i wa 9 something clicked and i started to view the world a a negative place the realization of not being able to form genuine friendship my friend dying and my father not really being there for u this sent me into a depression which i am still in today i won t lie i think about suicide quite often but i control myself by distracting myself with other activity instead of letting the thought get to me all they are are thought and they have become a coping mechanism i have gone through a few therapist and psychiatrist too although i stopped my ssri and adhd med when i wa i then became quite angry knowing there is no escape the day blended together day after day rotting away i became angry with myself and others and became very angry at others and closed minded in no way am i telling you to do anything i wa in a funk this winter and a friend of mine happened to have a gel tab of lsd and i asked to buy it later that night i took it and hopped on discord with a good friend of mine who also ha some of the same stuff going on a me and ha done mushroom so we relate well it wa unexplained the most beautiful feeling i have ever felt to explain it for someone who hasn t done psychedelics it the feeling that you are part of a bigger picture and that every moment ha lead up to this you are loved i am you and you are me i am still having a hard time putting it into word i laughed the hardest i had ever laughed and then realized what life is and started to get in my feeling and cry i cried for a while and hard too and then i thought the situation wa funny and started laughing again because i know wherever i end up i will make it and that life is such a beautiful thing not to be wasted or taken for granted i then went on to trip more time on lsd and twice on mushroom i am not saying go do psychedelics but for me they have done more than ssri ever did for me in the course of a night the feeling of having a clear place in the universe and being able to question with such a reduced sense of fear is amazing the feeling of going with the flow and seeing where life take you is a liberating feeling we were put here to love one another not kill ourselves and waste potential here are my final thought do your research before doing any psychedelic because if you take ssri it could mess you up real bad also i truly believe psychedelics are the way of the way of the future i still have depression yet it is a lot easier to cope with and feel a sense of calmness instead of absolute terror about whatever you are facing know that whatever is bringing you down i love you and the universe doe too you were put here to serve a a part of a much bigger picture just a small piece of a puzzle learn to love yourselves and others and peace will come to you in all aspect of life

"Exactly what the title says. Hollow and grey on the inside. do not have a single soul to express how i truly feel. I am 18 turning 19 in a week. Wish i never existed but with my luck.. I just had to be the one motherfuckin sperm that actually gets to the egg. Built this girl a whole brand new basement, got to know her really well, and even had her mom fall in love with me, and things were going great.. until she chose another man over me. that is okay i do not expect a damn thing from anybody. Nobody owes me shit. At least the very temporary company helped comfort my pain so slightly. Stuck working a back breaking job (general contractor) for my pops company. Underpaid as hell. Others my age are doing much less work and making much more money. Already got bad lower back pain at 18. Its all cool, hes my pops and i understand that I need to sacrifice some things. starting my second year of university in september (studying supply chain management). Forced to go to school solely because of my mom. Its okay, i guess ill get the degree to make her happy. First year was nothing due to covid. I also study the highest level of professional day trading education possible. I value lifting and being healthy so I incorporate the gym about 5-6x a week. its hard doing all this with nobody whatsoever. I pray and ask Jesus the Lord himself if he would just please bring a women in my life in his name and grace. Its sad to say it, but I just do not know if he answers my prayers. Nobody cares about me man, I feel alienated from human society. everything is bottled in, I am so stressed out that I got vitiligo. All i do is slave and work all damn day and it feels like nothing is progressing or getting accomplished. I am broke, broken, lonely, sad, hurt, angry, fragile. Trying my hardest to battle this. its so difficult man. Its all sinking in; Her picking another man over me, My friends ditching me for no reason, Running this damn contracting business with just my dad, literally not another soul (brutal back work), Being broke as fuck even tho it feels like I am working 16 hours a day. Trying to get the stock trading down so I do not lose my back and my dad at 21. Lifes pressuring me man. Just want a damn hug. Just seems like I put everyone else happiness first, and I finish last. I am praying for a sign, I am praying God turns my life around. I have officially hit rock bottom man. Goodnight, hopefully tomorrow is a good day in the markets so I can hopefully retire without a herniated disc. I have nobody. sad lonely and hurt"

"Out of curiosity does anyone (UK) know anyone I can get MDMA off ... (London)But that is not really the question there is not a question anymore all my life is is depression and anxiety issues. And I do not have a home I literally live in hotels the only thing keeping me off the street is my controversial job that people hate me for (not mentioning it here if you want to know its on my profile somewhere) So I have the stress of keeping a roof over my head with hotels no secure address no family bc they fucked me up minimal friends bc social anxiety gets the better of me depression that drains the living shit out of me so I cannot even get out of bed the whole day for weeks on end the only things that makes me temporarily happy is alcohol YouTube drugs, and sometimes Ill meet someone off the Internet just for a bit of excitement and they will make me feel better, oh but its never for long they always leave. Or I am to much to handle. Which is fine If I could control the way My life is I would. Partying drink drugs and meeting random strangers sometimes for temporary happiness is all I have got going for my life. At the moment. And I make more money than the average so why the fuck is it so hard to save ? Oh yeshh I am homeless and I have to live in the most expensive part of the uk to earn enough money to keep a roof over my head. Barely. Its lonely I am not on here for advice I am past that now I am just on here to spill my sorrows and feel sorry for myself, coz no one else will. do not need anyone to care or comment I am past the point of wanting anything from anyone. If I could choose to not exist I would. Imagine being able to flick a switch and sleep on demand for as long as you want Literally alcohol and YouTube are the only things that keep me going. And the occasional cocaine.. or even better mdma but that is hard to get hold of these days."

"Hi all, hope you are doing well. I Recently had a conversation with my significant other and it came out that she is been dealing with worse depression and anxiety lately.We talked about tackling it together. We talked about doing exercise together and eating well together. I have a question or two for you. 1. What things generally relieve the feelings of depression? 2. What gesture/action from someone else would make you feel better? Significant other is dealing with depression. What can I do?"

As someone who never felt love before, to see the person you loved with all your heart leave, and that too owing to your own fault, is extremely heartbreaking. Although I am numb to the pain now, I do not think I can function properly anymore. I just want to talk to someone, anyone. Please. why does love exist?"
"I do not even know, what to do. Others seem to be doing stuff all the time. It seems as if there are no to-do for me.

I could just stay where I am and sleep.Why do people do stuff? And how do they figure out, what to do? Such basic answers simply elude me. I do not do anything"
"Increased sex drive while manic I've been manic constantly for the past week and my sex drive has been out of control. To the point where my fiance has had to tell me to stop touching her. Not because it's uncomfortable, just that she has had enough intimacy and isn't interested in physical contact of the sexual nature.

In the past when I've been manic I avoid physical contact all together. I just don't like touching people or being touched. I don't know what it is about this time around but I'm always interested in sexual contact with my significant other.

Anyone else had this experience with randomly having an increased sex drive during a manic phase?"

"I have dealt with chronic depression from a very young age, I am currently 31yrs old. There have been times in the past where I though I was as bad as I could get. Felt that hopeless despair and apathy. Rock bottom.The depths to which my depression could truly sink was discovered two weeks ago. There was no catalyst for this change, everything simply got completely unmanageable. My current mental state is much worse than I could have ever imagined possible. Every minute of every day feels like physical pain. No brief moments of relief what so ever. Nothing can distract me. No desire to continue on. I always used to pride myself on being strong in the face on my depression, that suicide was never an option, not for me. In these past two weeks my suicidal ideation has been strong. Thinking of family and loved ones no longer steers me clear of this option. This is truly a scary place to be, and I fear I am losing myself entirely. I do not know what I am looking for here, perhaps just a place to speak my peace. Much love reddit, stay strong. My chronic depression has recently transformed into something far worse than its ever been."

"I have no idea how to talk about any of this. I have felt this way my entire life and nothing seems to change it. Its always as if I am on the outside looking in, I never seem to really fit anywhere. I have friends but there is always a barrier to how close we are. I mainly do not feel as if I have anyone to socialize with. there is periods of time where I feel like I am breaking through and I am about to have real friends and then something always happens to change that.Weird thing is, I am not alone, I have been in a relationship for a year and a half but we do separate things. Not that we do nothing together but in terms of socializing with other people we do not. He has his crowd and I have the outskirts of mine. I am not young, on the back end of my thirties and this desolate, alone feeling has never ceased. I live in an incredibly social city and I still cannot seem to find my place. Lately I am just more and more heartbroken over this, I am starting to believe I am just a loner. Therapy has not helped this aspect much. I do not have a clue anymore about any of it. I do not even know if this is depression or just who I am."

"Same illness for two years in a row! Need advice Could be TMI but here it goes:

So, this started in March 2016. I started noticing that just before I peed, I felt a sting every time before I passed urine. This when on for 2-3 weeks, then I got really scared and when to the doctor. They prescribed a urine test and also prescribed some medicines for UTI. The results came back negative for a UTI. A couple of days later, I had a really upset stomach with nausea and my roommate had to take me to the hospital. And I mentioned to the doctor about my prior visit. He prescribed another urine test, checked my penis for any issues (I also felt some tightness in my foreskin). He couldn't find any issues. And this urine test came back negative too. I was starting to panic as I the situation was not getting better. So, I had to fly back home to see another doctor( i was in college btw). Another doctor, another urine test and the result: nothing, nada, zilch!
It was same for some more time and then I started feeling gassy along with the initial symptoms. I got prescribed some gas relief medicines and that was it. All in all, this went for couple more months, then the sting before peeing, gradually went away.

So now a little over a year later, in June 2017. The same symptoms returned. And the same progression of symptoms occurred: the stinging sensation, and few weeks later the gassiness etc. But it was worse this time around, I had a very bad heart attack scare with symptoms like pain in the chest, my left arm going completely numb and gassiness. So, I was rushed to the hospital where they performed an ECG. I had a fever too. They concluded that nothing was wrong with me. Oh yeah, I had another urine test a couple of days earlier and it was negative. Amidst all this chaos, I had to travel and it had a 32 hour travel time. So obviously I wasn't looking forward to it. And my nightmare came true. I finished that journey with constant gassiness, nausea and uneasiness. So, I guess I'm not in a hurry to ever take on that long a journey ever again in my life. So, these symptoms finally improved but painstakingly slowly: 4 months.

So, my concern now is that it gonna be April soon, that means I might get this stupid mysterious illness again. What do I do? I feel about 70% just might be my head which is causing all of this anxiety.

Also i feel I was misdiagnosed everytime. The doctors always brushed it off with, ""Your results are fine, don't worry about it.""

"His mom and aunt like me too. But there have been some dark portions of our relationships, which I am ashed to talk about. First of all, the lightest part - when he is nervous because of something, he lashes out on me in shape of harsh criticism. Or he yells. 'You always stare at your phone!!!'"
"Do you think my doctor would object to me asking for an EKG for the sole purpose of soothing my anxiety? I've been having chest pain these past few days after a really bad heart palpitation that freaked me out. I recently saw my doctor three times in a row and worry about looking like I'm crazy for going in for something that is almost definitely anxiety. 

I just feel that an EKG would be quick and simple,  and I don't want to beat around the bush - I'd rather just tell her it's because I'm anxious. 

I guess the reason WHY I'm anxious is reason enough for a test?"

But now I came to accept that all of this is nothing more than just a dream that will never come true . I am tired of trying to get better because it will only get worse in the end .

"I got a new job! My greatest accomplishment was passing the state electrical exam with ADD but with the help of Ritalin. After being laid off from work several times because of being bipolar I went through depression which caused me to want to quit the trade. I have had a divorce from the field and don't want to be an electrician anymore. 

Hit with child support I found myself without a job for a long time. I worried I was going to jail for non payment and finally found a job at McDonald's making $7.25 an hour at 10 hours a week. Not enough to pay child support. 

I responded to an ad for a job remodeling fire/smoke/water damaged houses and aced my interview. I got the call today on the job offer. $11 an hour at 40+ hours a week. I went from $200/mo to $1760/mo. 

I used to make $4000/mo. But I'm happy I can finally pay my bills. Being jobless, a felon, a divorcée and not having filed my taxes since 2012 had me in crippling depression. I've since found a website I could file everything and will be doing that soon so I won't go to federal prison for tax dodging. 

After years of drug abuse with alcoholism I have also been sober three years. 

Small victories. "
I am coming to realize that almost all my old friends are not really good people and kind of take advantage of some things I offer. I am definitely not the greatest guy and life seems crushingly depressing for me right now but I am working on liking myself again and that means clearing negative influences from my life. these guys really the ONLY people I have hung out with since the beginning of high school in 2014. I am 21 now and I want to do so many things this summer but I now realize I might have to do them alone. unless I can make new friends I am probably going to fall back into that depression hole. Does anybody got advice on how to have fun and like being alone Making friends is hard anybody have advice on how to like hanging out by yourself

"Just another unhappy life? I‘m so unhappy. I dislike myself and my life so fundamentally, I don’t know how to fix it. I think I’m nothing much of anything and there doesn’t seem to be potential for growth. I’ve been wasting away to be honest. I don’t care about life, and the truly shitty thing seems to be, that nobody seems to be worth fighting to keep being. I’ve played along but it’s getting harder each day. My own dishonesty about how deep this runs has just been coming up a lot lately. I’m just always looking at the clock for time to pass, for oblivion to enter. I cannot stand existing, maybe that’s called depression, with other issues included, that just don’t seem worth solving at this point. So I’m just wondering, how is your life? How are you fairing and dealing with this? Do you have family that motivates you? Friends? Do you find ways to love life or make it work or worth it somehow? Are you ever angry?"

Meds are helping but i want to stop taking them I have definitely noticed a lot of changes in my mood and the way i treat others and others have seen my growth too.

There’s this voice telling me to stop taking them and i’m afraid of what’s going to happen if i actually do stop. does this happen to anyone else?

"I am a nurse and working at a high volume high stress clinic. I have been seeing some cool things and learning a lot. I was hired 4 weeks ago. In the meantime I suffered a very early term miscarriage and have sunk into a depression. The job, for as cool as it is, is also incredibly stressful. They are months behind on charting and severely understaffed to the point of important tasks slipping through the cracks by all the nurses/staff (referrals, scheduling, phone calls etc). I sat down with the manager to review that I feel overwhelmed at the job and had a full meltdown. The doctor of the clinic came to talk to me while I was crying and he told me he would pay for my psychology visits until I get back on track and reduce my work load. I have no idea why he made such a kind offer, I expected them to say the job would not work out. The manager called me later to check on me and tell me just to take a long weekend, but then she said something that a coworker said about me basically being dead weight if I am going to have special favors and a workload reduction which made me sink even further into a hole. Now I do not want to take the kind offer of the doc to pay for therapy etc, and I just want to quit. I do not want anyone thinking I am a burden or talking crap about me. I cannot face that person after what they said. Idk what to do Had a meltdown at a job I have only been at for 4 weeke"

Why cannot we just the more understanding and kind online? So much judging I get sad because I absorb it all. These people are talking so horribly about traits I have.

i wanted to share some of what i ve written because i find that writing is an outlet that help me to calm down sometimes i sit in a room full of people and stay quiet the loud chatter and the chaos of laughter will fill the room fill my head yet i keep my opinion and question to myself i keep my thought contained in my mind i watch a the girl who betrayed me smile and continues to talk i watch a my friend all happily converse with one another i watch a the boy throw their head back unable to control their laughter they ask if i am okay more quiet than usual and all i can say is that i am tired what they do not know is that i am not physically tired but mentally exhausted my mind is constantly racing overthinking every word that leaf my tongue every move i make and every awkward gesture that display itself during conversation with people i need a rest

"Upper Neck/ Spine Pain Anxiety So I've been diagnosed with GAD and I'm a senior in college so I've had unbelievably high stress and anxiety levels lately because of my impending graduation and uncertain future. Within the past few weeks I've developed this disturbing new symptom where whenever I start to feel anxious or stressed I get this weird pressure feeling in my neck, almost as if it is in my spine and someone is squeezing it. From there, my panic takes over and my heart begins to race, my stomach hurts and I feel nauseous, I get a tension headache, and I feel all wound up and ready to flee. My upper neck and shoulder muscles have been incredibly tight lately, so rationally I'm sure this spinal feeling is just a result of muscle tension and anxiety, as well as the crappy dorm mattress and my poor posture. However, I've convinced myself I have a brain tumor or am going to develop epilepsy or something. Dr. Google certainly didn't help because I Googled symptoms of a brain tumor and guess what, I have most of them! I just don't know what to do to calm myself down, I feel like I'm spiraling out of control. "

"Anyone felt like this? So first off, I apologize for the millionth post about “has anyone felt like this”. Been struggling to post anything for that reason. I’ve been having really bad anxiety these past 2-3 months. My dad passed away in December and I had to put my dog down a week ago so I definitely think this has affected my greatly. I’ve never felt this “bad” for this long. Been waking up most days shakey and nervous. Most days I’m worrying about my health and can’t seem to shake off intrusive thoughts. I went to the Doctor on Thursday and was told my blood pressure was high, which made me more anxious. Was precribed some for blood pressure and sertraline for the anxiety. Today I’ve been feeling dizzy, it comes and goes and just loosing interest in normal things. Just a general feeling of feeling off or not all here. Also can’t seem to swallow very well. 

I’m starting to exercise more and eating healthier. I’m hoping to see if anyone has any words of encouragement or has had a similar experience as mine. Also, anyone taking sertraline has any side effects? Anything would help rn. Thank you!

Edit: Side note last night I took a chocolate piece which had cbd and a strand of THC to help me sleep. It made me feel slow and like I wasn’t fully there and gave me really bad dry mouth feeling. Idk if maybe I’m still feeling those symptoms, because still feel out of it and my throat feels like I have something stuck there."
"So, I have struggled with major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, bpd, and I strongly believe adhd (it runs in the family and I have a lot of symptoms but I am not a doctor of course) for a long time now. I have done everything from therapy twice a week to countless medications. I quit my job a month ago because things hit a real low for myself and for this entire month, I have not really gotten out of bed for much. I joined this forum a couple days ago, and reading everyone is stories has been absolutely heartbreaking. It made me really feel like shit because here I am struggling to get off my ass and get out of bed, when people have it so much worse than me. When things were going really well for me, I decided to go to college and pursue a dream of mine. So I am signed up to start in the fall. Slowly but surely these past few days I have been kicking myself to get out of bed and take the steps to get better, because I have dreams, and I do not want to miss out on an amazing life because I am mentally ill. I want to document my progress because I want to be able to look back and be like it really did get better. This forum has really lit a fire under me, because I am so enraged at how depression and anxiety and all these mental illnesses get to come in and ruin peoples lives. No one deserves this. So here is my question: if I were to start a YouTube channel and upload my progress and what helps me and show my ups and downs and bumps in the road, would that help people? Because if I could touch or motivate just one soul, or be the one reason to try for someone, I would put everything out there. I think mental health is so hushed and it should not be. Its such a big problem and we need to talk about it and be aware of it. Obviously I am not a professional, but that is why maybe it would help? If people saw how badly I was struggling but I was still able to kick depressions ass? Idk. Its just a thought. And I know its risky to share that stuff with the public, but I just want to help people, ya know? because people have it so much worse than I ever imagined. And so many people feel alone and I do not want them to. Please be kind to me. I am just honestly asking. If people do not think its a good idea or if they can point out reasons that I cannot see for why its bad, then obviously Ill have my answer: do not do it. All I want is to help other people while helping myself if I can. Please be kind!! I have a question.."

"This happened a little while ago but it still bothers me that the person who was supposed to help me did me so dirty. About 5 years ago now I was really struggling and made the decision to try therapy one more time as I finally had insurance that would cover part of it. Prior to this Id attempted therapy twice, once was 2 sessions with a student counselor through my college but I was ultimately told that the free counselors they could provide were not qualified to handle my range of trauma and that it would be better if a sought out a licensed therapist, which I could not afford. The next time I did try and go to someone who was licensed, they also told me I was not a good fit. I was seemingly functioning fine in the day to day (I thought I was, in retrospect not at all) and again my trauma was not their skill set. They suggested I seek out someone specialized. So I gave up for a while. It was not until my life was taking a major dive and I realized I was out of control to stop it that I tried again. Shortly before I began looking for a therapist, I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 26. In general, I am so pissed at not being listened to or just overlooked by doctors. That could be its own rant. But I was only diagnosed because I asked if it was possible. Id learned the actual symptoms of how ADHD presents in both women and adults for the first time and it was eye opening. So much of what Id complained about or told doctors I struggled with (attention, time management, zoning off) explained in one simple and now obvious thing. The tests were more than conclusive. So when I came across a therapist that specialized in ADHD along with, supposedly, some of my other specific traumas, I felt it would be good to be able to figure out a path forward with someone who understood how ADHD affects how I might function and think. The first red flag I should have paid more attention to, and I am still shocked by it. I had started to suspect I might be bipolar in addition to my depression, but was scared what that might mean for me. A few sessions in I brought it up. I still clearly remember her response: Oh no, you are not bipolar. You have cyclical depression. Bipolar you would have manic episodes where you think you can fly or kidnap a kid and think its your own, or *do really impulsive, damaging things*. I said the last bit sounds like me and she said But you do not think you can fly or that you are invincible right? I said no, she said not bipolar. I have never been diagnosed to this day, but the older I get the more I suspect it, and I know that there is more than one type of bipolar, and think she was very wrong to dismiss me. If she would have let me, I would have told her how I have times where I am convinced nothing bad will come of spending money that leaves me in financial ruin time and time again and I *know* its not normal. Or how I moved to a different country on a split second decision. Or how every tattoo I have ever had I have decided to get and gotten within 48 hours or less, with no foresight and usually regret after. At the start she was easy to talk to, and ended up helping me with my ADHD by giving me a referral to a doctor that specializes in only mental health, and they prescribed me meds that have vastly improved my quality of life. We did not focus on my past trauma at the beginning, its really hard for me to bring up and she would *never* ask me anything or suggest something from my life we should talk about *except* the ADHD. Which to me was a small facet of my life that was now being taken care of by the prescribing doctors (1 hour sessions, at the beginning there were 5 or 6 in the first 3 months and now they are once every 3 months). It got to the point of me just complaining about my problems from the week or my stresses about the upcoming week which was not really the reason I started going but it still helped. she would try and tie everything to the ADHD and I just let it go. I did not have the energy to find *another* therapist, I still figured wed get around to it eventually, and just knowing I had my weekly appointment coming up helped me get through a lot of the daily crap that would come up and Id have to deal with. After about 9 months or so of weekly sessions, she shocked me one day by telling me that she did not think she would be able to help me as I was too resistant to discussing the ADHD and that it was not worth the financial strain of the copay (which it was, I still paid $50 each session) to talk about my day to day problems. She said we should focus on an end date unless I was willing to put more work in to it. I said we still had not gotten around to *any* of what I told her I needed to deal with in my first session, and she said that she was not really qualified for the extent of my trauma but that we could try though she suggested I see multiple counselors *at the same time* and that was probably the only way Id be able to get the help I needed. Now, possibly the most overwhelming of my past trauma is abandonment related. Which she knew. In my brain there would never be an end to therapy. I was settling in to the idea of seeing her and every week until I moved or she retired. I was comfortable there, I felt safe with her and the routine, so when she said we should end things it brought it all back. I can truly see that moment as when the final dominos started to fall. I went from feeling to safe to desperate to be worthy. I agreed to whatever just so she would not end the sessions. The first thing she did was something that she told me was a new, exciting method to help patients stop disassociating and bring them in to the present. Was disassociating a problem, a little, but later found out what Id been describing to her is maladaptive daydreaming. She just decided it was disassociation because of the ADHD.The method was this: first you closed your eyes and sat very still and centered yourself. She would say feel your feet, feel your hands, feel your breath, etc. Basic meditation/grounding exercises you can get free on YouTube. Then you would open your eyes and for however long until she said stop you had to tell her exactly what you are feeling and noticing and thinking presently. You could not think or say I am really stressed. It had to be physical like, I see a clock on the wall. My leg itches. there is a book on the bookshelf with a red spine. Anytime you would veer off a little, she would stop you and make you do it right. I *hated* it. Every time Id make these complaints, she would tell me its supposed to be uncomfortable, that is how you know its working. The thing was, Id spend all week preparing to talk about something important. Id take notes on what I wanted to talk about. I remember a few times I brought in letters or journals from my past I wanted to discuss and wed NEVER get around to any of it because she would spend at least the first 30 minutes doing the damn exercises, and another 5 minutes every other session trying to convince me to join her ADHD group therapy sessions, *which were another $50 copay*, no matter how many times I said no. I started leaving feeling frustrated and sad that I had not gotten to discuss what was actually quite difficult for me to prepare to say. Perhaps because of the fact that every single session I showed up with heavy thoughts on my mind and every single session she would force us to begin with this stupid exercise, but she made me *so much worse*. Id been casually disassociating *forever*. She did not teach me any skills to process or cope with these things being on the surface. But now my anxiety is tied with my life, I cannot separate the two. Doing things like looking at a clock or noticing a book on a shelf gives me anxiety. I am constantly overwhelmed by that fear of impending doom whenever I try and focus on reality. The only way I can get some respite is if I can manage to zone out the rest of the world entirely, which includes my day to day. I went from functional to entirely non-functional. Therapy with her ended when I had decided to move, which went badly. I was going to move in with a friend across the country. In the weeks leading up to the move anytime I expressed my doubts or fear something would go wrong she would tell me to stop focusing on the worry and just let something good happen. Yea, well, friend showed up to drive back with me and was a major AH and went from being my absolute best friend I have ever had, still, to years later were still not speaking. And I had no skills to cope, and had one of the worst breakdowns of my life. These days I am not even a little okay. I am not bringing in enough to make ends meet. My car is my income and it needs repairs. I used to shower daily, now sometimes I cry because I want to shower so bad and cannot bring myself to do it. The depression makes it so hard to get out the door and work, and if I do not manage it then the depression gets worse. I signed up for cerebral tonight because I need help bad and my insurance does not cover it. My grandma is helping me pay for it for now which makes me feel awful but I cannot on my own. My first therapist appointment is Monday and I am so scared they are going to be like all the others and tell me they cannot help me. I am so alone and lost idk what Ill do if they cannot. My grandma is the only person I know within a 4 hour drive, and for reasons Id rather not go in to is not the best emotional support. If you made it to the end, thanks so much for listening. Remember you are not alone, and who you are is beautiful. I am starting therapy again after my last one was a horrible experience and I need to vent about it for a minute"

Morning?
I lack a support system. My mom is dead. My father lives over a thousand miles away and does not care about me. My ex gf left months ago. I now have limited/no friends. Okay now my sad story is over. I do not know what to do. I thought making money and working hard would make me happy and make the people around me happy. Hint: it does not. I guess I am lonely. I want to have someone in my life that will talk to me and care about me. I want to care about them. I guess I want to have a purpose or someone to share life with. Today I watched the sunset. I wish I had someone to share that with. I start to think the world is better without me and what is the point? All I have now is my career. I admit I probably pushed others away or did not understand their problems. Now I am alone. Now I am sad. :( I fear I am becoming depressed (Male 26)
"This entire year has been a montage of pain and suffering, I was basically bullied out of school until my dad pulled me out; One time when I was at this school I was given the chance to get into the school but I said no due to me being fickle and impulsive I know have no chance of getting in because I have not ""completed year 11"" correctly, I do not know how I can get into this one next year, I feel alone in this... Next year I do not know if I can get into the school I want"

"The paranoia is killing me I feel so isolated and afraid. Things are turning, crumbling. I feel like I can't turn to anyone. My psychologist and doctor understand but damn the nights are so long, and in the day, I have to be around so many people I can't tell what's going on for me. Some professionals even don't understand me unless they know me very well. I'm a serial masker and even when I'm wanting to throw a chair through a window I'll just casually say ""I'm raging right now"" and they don't take notice lol. So some professionals don't take notice and others say things like ""I'm very alarmed"" at my behaviour. I just can't be that person I used to be anymore; exploding rage and emotion. Luckily a have professionals that see the signs clearly but talking to others can make me feel invisible.

I feel like everyone in society, the world around me, online, is watching everything I'm saying and doing, even people in cars or shop assistants. Which I know sounds ridiculous, but I feel like I can't move a muscle or say a thing, it's constant. It's even hard to post here.

It was fun with the spiritual and sensual bliss but now it's just hell. I made the mistake of having a nap before midnight and I won't sleep tonight. I got an exam today, I'll see my nurse thankfully, then my therapist, but right now I just see this long stretch of night ahead of me. The house is so quiet, I'm worried I'll see ghosts if I leave my room lol. I just feel so very alone.

College helped so much, they're very supportive there, my classmates are amazing but it's getting confusing for me there, too. My mouth is starting to get me in trouble. I feel like my world is getting smaller section by section. 

My psychologist said it was ok for me to go to a Buddhist centre for a few days as long as I don't drive there, as long as I stick to grounding meditation rather than the transendental stuff lol. So maybe that will help me a lot.

I don't even know what this post is about. It's just all crumbling down, now. I might try to switch channels in my brain rather than hyperfocusing on my phone. Have something to eat and drink. Maybe try sleep again.

I'm focusing so inwardly; thoughts, feelings, etc. I need to get out of my head and into my body. I try to do the mindfulness 5 things but I'm too paranoid about ghosts right now. I wanna listen to my headphones but can't for the same reason. I think I'm literally too afraid to leave my bed or do anything but type, and too paranoid to ring a hotline. I'm dreading 3 am but hopefully I will be asleep by then.

I dunno, maybe this post is an ask for someone out there to make me feel like I'm not one alien on an Earth full of humans lol. Either way I just gotta get it off my chest."

"Tested a VR headset (for phone, Bobo Z4) &amp; before I could adjust settings to get rid of incorrect settings (the screen was double), I felt my left eye sting and after that, weird sensations in my eye areas and in my head/brain... kinda electrical and spasm-like, worried Health anxiety sucks - it sucks more when its symptoms overlap with the symptoms of physical conditions.

But the symptoms described in the title above were a little... odd. Epilepsy-concerns emerge, perhaps mild, but still leaving me concerned. Could it just be something that had to do with my eyes needing to adjust, or the settings not being correct and thus messing me up for a bit, or should I be worried about epilepsy/photosensitivity? I figured I'd ask around to see if it is a sound concern... no access to a doctor right now unfortunately, gotta wait til tomorrow.

"Health anxiety is a vicious circle. Not sure if anyone has this, but my health anxiety can fixate around my vision. Thus becoming a vicious circle of worrying about my vision, which makes it worse, which in turn I then worry about...so on and so forth.

"One nostril starting to swell up This started yesterday morning. I had dreams of having a sinus infection and one nostril has been clogged ever since. It doesnt change from one side to the other like typical congestion. 

Ive used some oxymethoziline and zicam but the top part of my nostril is still clogged. It feels like somethings stuck in there. Ive used my neti pot 3-4 times since then but nothing comes out. No mucus, no pressure just a nagging swelling.

Is this just a common cold coming on? Nasal Polyps? I really dont wanna go see an ENT because I just saw one 3-4 months ago for allergies and they said my sinuses were healthy.

If I lift up my nose and look inside it seems like the top of my nostril is more swollen on one side then the other."

"I feel guilty about being alive I feel as though all my life I have been becoming unlovable. I can see myself decay. The things I enjoyed are meaningless and because I exist and interact with others, I take a part of the joy away from them too.

But I don’t want to hurt the few people that might get affected by it. I feel guilty to a point where I wish I get terminally ill and succumb.

I feel guilty for taking up space and being here."

So I switched to oxcarbazepine, That didn’t work at all so now I’m back on Abilify. I feel like I just can’t win. I have a fairly privileged life so complaining just feels wrong, but I really need to vent. I just hate myself for hating myself (if that makes any sense). I feel like I’m treating the people around me like shit witch makes me feel worse. I don’t mean to, my terrible thoughts just slip out. Every thing just kind of hurts. I’m tired."

"Hi all,(24/F)I have been taking 30mg of nortriptyline since 2015 for general anxiety and to help with some depression/sleep issues. It has worked pretty well for me, no complaints. I have not loved the fact that I cannot drink alcohol much (it just intensifies it a lot) but other than that I have been able to sleep great and my anxiety/depression has been under control the past 6ish years. However, I am finding it not to be as effective anymore; I am not sure why, but my anxiety is back lately (fluttery feeling constantly, just general anxiety for a lot of the days) with nothing really provoking it - nothing worrying me or anything anxiety inducing in particular. Lately I have found it extremely hard to wake up and get out of bed in the mornings, and I cannot really drink caffeine either, so most mornings I am up around 9:30 and just feel super tired for a good part of the morning.I am considering switching to Celexa/citalopram- my boyfriend and sister are both on it and they seem to really like it. My only concern is that it will affect my sleep - I hear it can make it hard to fall asleep/stay asleep. Another concern is tapering off nortriptyline while introducing a new medication at the same time. I am going to talk to my doctor this week about it, but just wondered if anyone has any insight on switching or going off nortriptyline. Any advice would be appreciated! Wanting to switch my medication from Nortriptyline to Celexa (Citalopram)"

"Title says it all.Round-about 1 month ago today I attempted to be helpful in a community only to be met with claims of homophobia &amp; spreading negativity, despite what I said equally criticizing everyone involved and encouraging being open and kind.On that same day, I contemplated suicide for what I could only hope would be the last time, believing I had done nothing but proven to be my own worst fear.Today, one month later, I gave an attempt at reconciliation my absolute all.Today, I allowed myself to be vulnerable for the first time in 3 years.And today, I was rejected in the worst way I can possibly imagine.I wrote my most deep-seated apology to those I had wronged and to those who believed I was nothing more than an unapologetic piece of shit. I posted it, and I waited.I waited 5 minutes, then 15 minutes, then 30 minutes. Before I knew it, I would been staring at the screen for over two hours, waiting, praying for someone to say something.After two hours I got a response, and all it did was make everything so much worse. It solidified my view of myself, being unable to do right despite my every attempt, my countless efforts done in all manner of ways.Two hours of waiting, and all I got was someone telling me that I was banned for a reason, implying that my effort, despite it being done in the nicest way I could muster, was in vain.If you were to tell me 1 month ago that attempting to be kind would because me to, in a way, spiral down a rabbit hole of self-pity and self-loathing I would have called you a pessimist. I would have attempted to justify it with optimism and passion that is rarely seen these days.But now? Now I would call you a speaker of nothing but the truth, in that regard.it is the sad reality that I have now come to realize encompasses my whole being. The sad reality that I am a broken light in the dark tunnel that is everyday life. A light still sputtering but quickly losing its function. I am not sure where else to post this really, take it down if you all must but I feel it can be good to read for those feeling down. To see that maybe their day or maybe their situation is not as bad as it first appears. Today, I tried and absolutely failed to be a better person."
"So i just moved out from my moms house and my home town after 22 yrs. And as much as i like it, i am also anxious and stressed. Its probably because i have a puppy/9 months which i brought with me, it is mine afterall. But since its my first dog ever and my first time ever moving out i am very overwhelmed. I had depression long before i moved out or got a dog aswell. When i was home in my hometown i felt less stressed because of much less responsibility.. now i have work, i have my dog, rent to pay, bills, food expenses and gas for my car.. I have exams in 3 months which i need for my apprenticeship/where i work.. I am so stressed and overwhelmed and idk what to do. I feel like I am going to get very mentally ill if i keep feeling like this for a long time. Also i am living underneath the people i pay rent to, they have a dog too, and whenever he barks, my dog will also bark.. i feel like I am failing to train my dog correctly aswell because of this. Depressed, stressed, anxious."
"But if you DO RESPOND, your brain thinks ""great, that must have been useful, I'll send that thought again!"" To re-iterate, you can't directly control the thoughts your brain sends, but you can MANIPULATE what it sends by giving it feedback by either Responding or NOT RESPONDING. The more you respond with COMPULSIONS, the more your brain will throw that thought at you. Paradoxically, the things you are doing to relieve your Anxiety are making your OCD worse. The more Compulsions you engage in, the stronger the Obsessions become."

"My life has pretty much been a downward spiral for 10 years now, ever since I permanently injured my right shoulder in gymnasium (European equivalent of high school).The injury is what started it all, but as time passed, my depression gradually grew into what it is today, in the beginning it was only negative thoughts about my injury, but as time passed and the negative thoughts got worse, they started seeping into every aspect of my life, until negative, downright self deprecating thoughts became the norm.I no longer feel like I am actually living my life, it feels like I am just going through the motions, most days I just feel numb and I cannot remember what it is like to wake up and be excited about the day ahead. But just to be clear, I have accepted that I do not have it in me to kill myself, but if I am going to continue living, I do not want to continue down the self destructive path I am on. As for the lying part. As of writing this, I am completely broke, on the verge of being kicked out of my apartment and I was kicked out of my university for inactivity 2 months ago and after having studied for 4 years, I am actually happy that I do not have to study anymore, since enrolling was just a thing I did, mainly to have a community to be a part of, but it did not help me and the stress of constantly studying, just added to it all.My family do not know any of this and I have been too scared to tell them all this, but now I have reached a point where I do not care anymore and am actually considering telling them about it all. Also because they keep asking me about my studies and my life in general and I just cannot keep lying about it anymore, I cannot keep track of the lies and it is tearing me apart, that this is what my life has become. I am mainly considering telling them, because I have come to the conclusion that I cannot get out of this myself and that I need help. No matter what plans I make to lessen the feeling of hopelessness they all amount to nothing, as the crushing hopelessness of it all, makes it hard must any energy to do anything but just drift along with whatever happens. I am considering just telling my parents about it all, so I do not have to lie about my life anymore."
"Heart Disease, depression, anxiety, and stress This semester I am taking Abnormal Psychology. One of the chapters I had the misfortune of reading was on the physical health effects of negative emotions, something I am chocked full of. Whether its stress, anxiety, depression, anger/frustration, I show it. My mood bounces around a lot. 

Even at my young age of 23 I am starting to worry about developing heart disease, something my neurotic nature seems to be a predictor of. Most of my life I've eaten a poor diet (although my cholesterol was only 150, with my LDL at 88 and my HDL at 30. No idea about cortisol, CRP, or interlukins though). 

I have also been pretty sedentary (though that is very slowly starting to change) since I turned 18 and have had a slew of medical problems since then. My gums have receded more (I fought off gingivitis but am on the cusp of developing gum disease from gum recession). I used to get very angry at video games, I developed tinnitus a year ago which drives me crazy, and I'm depressed and socially isolated. 

I have no know history of heart disease, but of depression and low serotonin. Thus I am stuck in a dilemma. I also started taking amphetamine mediation for ADHD in January, so my heart rate tends to be higher on average but I eat less and have lost weight. In some cases, my blood pressure is normal on stimulants even when it feels elevated. I'm paranoid about my health, a bit of hypochondriac. I vape, don't drink anymore, and and am an on and off smoker. 

All of these things and more point to heart disease. I cannot just relax however, and I refuse to take antidepressants. I detest those medications and will take any medicine for depression that is not an antidepressant or antipsychotic. Even at the cost of my life from getting heart disease, I will risk low mood, higher inflammation, and more clotting and an early death than take those. 

I have often been pointed to exercise as the key, which I will do in the form of jogging. I will not do yoga, even if its ""relaxing"" because I think its a stupid form of a exercise. I want a form of exercise where I can feel angry and aggressive. Maybe that defeats the point but at least its something. 

I need some answers within my confines. Diet changes are hard because I'm a picky eater and will throw up if something doesn't taste good. Regular, good sleep is also out of the question because, for some reason, I rarely sleep more than 4-5 hours consecutively. Exercise is pretty easy, I'm just a bit lazy. 

I'm open to ideas but antidepressants are absolutely out of the questions. "
do you listen to the radio?
if anyone feels like people are mocking you or mocking others for looking 'miserable' or looking 'sad' all the time. do not listen to them.your feelings are valid just as much as them. also remember as soon as they suddenly feel the way you were feeling they will not be so quick to judge the way you are feeling the next time. you are allowed to be sad/depressed
do you think anyone will come to my funeral?
"Sometimes somebody tells me something and I get sad. A sadness overcomes me so strong that I do not know how to get rid of it, no matter how hard a try. I just want to live a normal life. Meet honest and loyal people, and be happy. But when sadness overcomes me, I am stuck. Stuck physically and stuck in my feelings. I do not how to to handle it. Sometimes"
my personal web site wa hacked what should i do
I get so angry and sad all of the time to the point where it does not even feel like I am me. I think about ending it sometimes just because I do not want to bring this on my friends and family. it is not me. But it is becoming me. I have had a migraine for 12hrs and I cannot sleep. It just fucking sucks. I just want to be healthy. I feel like I have a corrupted mind

"Everyone I have ever known in my life has made me feel so fucking small and inferior. I never had the strength, bravery, or self-esteem to stand up to these people. And even though I am technically an adult I am fucked in my head because of all the shit people around me did to me! I cannot deal with people, I am afraid and angry with people and the world. I am sick of being weak and cowering away, but I cannot stand up to them. They continue to make me feel small and weak and that just makes me feel more worthless, more useless, and I just want to end it. My actual only hope is I get the strength to end it so I do not have to suffer, so I do not have to feel like a worthless piece of shit. Everyone has made me feel like a burden, like my existence is a problem, yet I did not ask to exist, but they blame and get mad at me.I fucking hate the world full of these fuckers who make people feel small, worthless, and in their way. But so many people could not give a fuck about mental illness or how many people have offed themselves because people chose to be fucking assholes. I wish they would all just drop dead! I wish their lives would turn upside down and they could know what it feels like when the world is against you! When your battling your own mind and body. it is fucking exhausting! Everyone Has Made Me Feel Small and Inferior..."

"I asked him how it was different. Why taking a thyroid medication for the rest of my life to correct a chemical imbalance was better than taking an antidepressant to correct a chemical imbalance. He did not have an answer. My husband, who ""does not like"" antidepressants, was very excited at the idea that if my depression is related to low thyroid I could take thyroid medication to help it"
"I found out my boyfriend of two years (who was getting ready to move in with me) had spent the entire first 7 months of our relationship having a whole other girlfriend simultaneously. He got her pregnant and abandoned her to stay with me instead. When I found all of this out, I was devastated and broke up with him. But, I cannot help but think of all the reasons I loved him and how hard it is to quit someone cold Turkey that you were so deeply in love with. I have battled depression previously and now feels like the lowest point I have ever had. Any advice would be appreciated. How do you fall out of love with someone that majorly betrayed you?"

"I do not know if this is a depression thing or not, but pretty much my heart can run up to 90bpm but I can still fall asleep with so much ease. Sometimes I cannot even stay awake even though my heart will be like that. Anyone else experience this? it is been this way for me for many years. I can drink a lot of caffeine and still fall asleep if I want to. it is easier to prompt myself to stay awake with caffeine consumption, but if I want to sleep, it is no problem. TLDR: Anyone get a fast heartbeat yet still sleepy as hell? Racing heart but still sleepy as fuck"

"Unfortunately, I am 17F and three months away from turning 18 I do not expect medical advice but just to rant. A year ago I was in a psych ward after a previous attempt of suicide and I was assigned to see a therapist since I got discharged and I had multiple fucked up episodes since, the most recent one costing me my job temporarily. I was out of work for a month my therapist told me it was likely I have bipolar disorder and assigned for me to see a doctor the next month. We do not have a car so my narcissistic father had to take me but told me he could not take us (he did not want to do it because I yelled at him for yelling at my mother for asking for financial support and saying that that is exactly why he left her). He refused to take me after waiting a month for care because I ""swore"" at him for blaming us for his bullshit narcissism. He said to my mother until I apologize for my actions he is going to stop taking care of me (dental needs, doctors appointments, etc.) My mom does not believe in medication and I am not really a fan either, but since bipolar has been pointed out to me the hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia, impulsive decisions, and suicide attempts, make sense because of the dramatic shifts in my moods a few times a year. I believe I am manic at the moment because my decision making gets waaaaay more fucked up than usual and I am loud, fast talking, energized, and have not slept for more than 5 hours a night and now I am not sleeping at all regardless of 9 hours shifts at work. I only have insight now because it happened to me so many times. I am really irritable at my mother because I have to be like this because until I am 18 I have no say in my care. She does not believe in medicine and I do not like medicine either but I do not want to be like this anymore. She calls me dramatic when I feel like I am going through hell in my mind. Everyone just feels the need to call me a bitch:Me: *Did not sleep AT ALL after closing at work and when I almost had a remote chance at sleeping my niece starts screaming her head off*My sister: *who recently shit on me for crying about a recent miscarriage I had at a baseball game and asking to go home when she wanted to see fucking BIG AND RICH (lmao) literally yelled at me the whole time for asking to leave in front of zillions of people starts hissing at me and blaming me for waking up her child when she was clearly already awake and screaming when I got up*Me: *Pissed because of this*My sister: ""you are SUCH A BITCH!"" Then there is my mom:Me: *exhausted but cannot sleep due to the episode*My mom: ""Take out the garbage.""Me: ""Okay.""My mom: ""I said do it now! I do everything around here and you just lay there.""Me:*did not sleep after work, just hates life in general and does not want to react the way I do but she keeps freaking out* ""IT WILL GET DONE I PROMISE YOU!""My mom: ""You always say that. You always have to have things done your way."" *Proceeds to threaten to call my dad or someone to yell at me*Me:*Yells expletives out of extreme anger, starts screaming and covering ears because of sensory overload, and BEGS her to leave me alone because NOTHING would be more relieving at that point*My mom: *Walks away* ""you are so dramatic.""My mom does not get that I have a disease in my brain. She makes me live like this and it makes me so angry when she says stuff like that.My dad in a nutshell: *Is bipolar himself, narcissistic, and blackmails me for taking care of me*I hate it when people try to tell me that it is because I am ""a teenager"" I want those people to go to hell. I have tried to die 3 times, cannot function without a stimulant, lost a child, was shit on for having feelings about it, have abandonment issues because of my dad leaving when I was one, forcing me to be in this world with these problems and then replacing me AND HE STILL does not LET US FORGET! LOL (not to mention people who have called me a mess and left and used me on a romantic level), have three current diagnoses already, and if I express myself I get called a bitch or ""Somebody has it worse""I am done.I feel like genuinely crying but my moods will not let me. I deal with manic episodes and I am called dramatic by my mother who will not let me go on medication *Not as long of a story as it looks*"
I don’t recognize myself I just need to rant real quick. Everything sucks. I’ve been stuck in dpdr for about 2 years now. It’s been bad but it’s gotten worse. My home life hasn’t been great for a while now. My parents have been fighting a lot and recently told me they were going to divorce soon. My sister constantly degrades everyone in the house and will sit around all day and refuse to go to school. My mom is having work trouble. And my dad has kinda been the punching bag of it all. Fighting and yelling has become a regular occurrence. I cant stand it. I’ve been trying to keep myself together and come off as calm so maybe some stress could be taken off of everyone but I’m actually falling apart inside. My theory is if they see that I’m calm they will have one less thing to worry about. I’m always anticipating the next fight between any of the three and it sucks. I actually feel a sense of relief at school because atleast I’m away from all this. But schools not any better. I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t recognize myself in the mirror. I don’t see me I see a shell. I want to get out and run away from everything. Im only 15 so that’s not an option though. Nothing feels real and I just don’t want to be here anymore. I just feel stuck and I have no one to talk to. Every time I would try to talk to my mom about my dpdr she would say I’ve been looking at the internet too much. I don’t want to talk to her about it because im scared she’ll say that again or explode from all the stress. She also dumps all her work problems on me and that just adds to the stress. I’m just scared. I don’t want them to divorce. I just want things to go back to the way they were. I don’t know how much longer I can hold it in. I was diagnosed with depression a couple years ago and have meds but I’m so tired and drained that I can’t remember to take them. I just don’t know what to do anymore.

"Recently turned 18, been depressed for over a-decade, dealt with mental issues since I was born which has left me with a empty pain filled childhood. have not had girl friends or relationships, and I have tried to lie to myself and other that it is because I am not ready for one, and while that is true, I also just really wish I had someone I could hold, someone to hold me, someone that when I get those thoughts I can immediately think of them to make those thoughts go away. Instead, I have spent my entire life with these thoughts slowly eating away at me and my soul and I am scared because I do not have much more to give. I just want to feel okay. I am loosing my fight, how do I keep going someone please fucking help me I cannot be the only one feeling this way. numb, exhausted, lonely, and at my wits end. I hardly ever cry when I breakdown nowadays and that fucking scares me. Looking at my future is like staring into an black empty abyss just waiting for when you finally decide to jump. Anyone else feel this way. I am really struggling right now, how do I deal with this emptiness?"
"i just do not want to wake up. i do not even want to sleep. nothing good is coming. I am alone, I am desperate , nothing feels real anymore. I am already kept pushing so long just for it to fall apart over and over I am so tired i do not want to keep on i just wwnt to stop but i keep moving and working and trying to talk to people and its led to this. nothing I am empty but for reget and shame about who i am what i want and all i have not done. i do not see a reason to push on , i do not have anything to look forward to, just another day where I am not enough for anyone not even myself. i do not see a difference between tomarrow yesterday or the day before its all the same feeling , i want it to end. i want to be able to tell myself i did enough, i held out long enough, that its ok to just give in, but i always feel like tomorrow could be the day something changes, if i just push a bit more i can be happy. i honestly hate it. i just want to stop I just want to stop"

"Advice - Long Term Relationships I have been with my boyfriend for almost 7 years, and for about 5 of those years we were aware I am bipolar. I am noticing it is really starting to take a toll on him…. The highs and lows, the impulsivity, the lack of coping skills I have….. I don’t know what to do anymore because the feelings of guilt are consuming me and I’m becoming impulsive and just empty….

How can a long term relationship truly survive?

"I have been battling depression and anxiety+social anxiety for more than a decade now. Surprisingly, I have been able to finish my undergraduate degree with a very good score by working my ass off, by stressing myself out every day that without it I will not have a future (which I know is not true : no matter what happens, I will not have a future).I have applied to several Master's degrees : in my country, each Master's degree is unique, and in undergraduate classes, you have 300 students and only 30 are selected to enroll in a Master's degree.Well, I was preselected for a Master's degree I am interested in (after being rejected by so many others, who considered that my ""personal"" work was not good enough, which hurt a lot). I had an interview on Monday and I just f*cked it up so badly. I was not even able to introduce myself or my works. If it were not for that interview, I feel like I could have had a chance.The results are tomorrow and I am freaking out. I am terrified that I will not get in. This Master's my last chance.I just do not know where to post this. Sorry, I just needed to rant. My life has been miserable for the past few months : I have been trying to save a friendship (my one and only friendship) with someone who is not interested at all at reciprocating 1/10th of my effort, my boyfriend is in another country and because of COVID I have not seen him in 7 months, my vacations with said boyfriend might be cancelled because of a new rise in COVID's cases.I am so f*cking tired. When trying your best is never enough"

"Problems being around friends and being with friends when depressed. Whenever I'm depressed I can't be alone, when I'm alone I can get really overboard with how I think. When I'm alone in the moment I can feel like I'll be thinking completely rationally but if I'm in the same mood around people I care about my mindset will can add will be completely different."

"Not sure if this is the best sub for this but I still think it is a good question.As someone who perhaps is not as socially skilled as it should be, I watch a lot of self-improvement/social skills videos. The advice they give is ""say the things you do not think are worth saying"" or something along those lines to keep a conversation going. But my problem is I simply run out of things to say, good or bad, and I totally blank until the other person picks up the conversation.Is this something any of you relate to? Running out of things to say"

"I have found through personal experience that isolation causes false thinking, reduced social skills, reduced confidence and as a result of false thinking, depression. I have devolved through prolonged isolation to the point of muttering words to new people. Too anxious to accept hospitality or to interject appropriately in a conversation.There is a saying to the effect of - the mind is a loaded gun and the individual has no protection against it.I often fantasize about giving away everything I own and moving to the other side of the earth. Detached from any connections, free to disappear into the abyss. CBT has shown me somewhat how to talk back to my thoughts. I need more practice however. 2 sessions is not enough.Carol Dweck suggest talking back at the thoughts, to argue for the truth. To examine the accuracy of what is being said to yourself.When life is going well, life is precious. When life is going poor, life is a curse. False thinking"
"lol that is pretty much it. They go from being a stranger, to a friend, to your best friend, to the love of your life, to a stranger. When you think you found the one... but they shatter your heart."
"Sometimes I feel like people just will not listen to this simple truth. They always want to blame it on you being the problem. I am going to use some of my disabilities and quirks as an example. First off I was born left handed. When I was a child it was virtually impossible to find people to teach you things left handed. So I learned to do most things outside of writing right handed or tried to learn on my own. This basically cut me off from ever pursuing a career that required precise technical abilities. Think surgeon, athlete, etc. I was also born with adhd, which went undiagnosed until my teen years when learned behavior becomes harder to introduce. I was repeatedly punished because I was treated like the rest of the kids. This had a rather horrible effect on me and forced my thoughts and my self inward later in life. And I believe this is where my life long depression took root. I still to this day struggle with simple tasks that neurotypicals do not even bat an eyelash at. Lastly I was born with the learning disability dyscalculia. I was actually good at math when I had the time and patience to work out the numbers. I only ever had one math teacher who had patience with me and low and behold I excelled that year. The rest of my math life is full of shame, yelling, and bad grades. Considering all this all I ever hear from therapists, family, and friends is its all in your head, you can do anything I can just as well but I cannot....So why is not it normal for me to be depressed? there is no fix for my two disabilities. I am doomed to be less adjusted and slower than everyone else. When almost every well paying and secure job is out of reach for you you are fucked. I am just so tired of people treating me like a worthless lazy bastard when in reality I am trying 10x harder than most of my peers. Life is objectively unfair for some people"
i haven t thought about killing myself since 0 yet here we are today year later getting closer to 0 and i m in the bathroom of my workplace and the only thing i can think of is slicing my wrist when i get home i haven t slept in 0 hour and i m seriously considering drinking my pain away maybe i ll puke in my sleep and get done with it i don t care if anyone will cry for me probably will but i m in pain so much pain guy
"Idk if its the right sub for this but currently I am fucking depressed because I am withdrawing from a drug, yeah addict lifestyle. I am with my family right now should be happy but I am not. When I think about I do not even remember the last time I was truly happy. This is been going on for years and the withdrawal only makes it worse. People think I am lazy and do not want to do anything but that is simply not true. I have goals too that I want to reach but sometimes things get too much. I am surely not as depressed as some of you I just needed to let this out once since I cannot/will not tell anyone. Severely depressed because of withdrawal"

"Hey, I am from Brazil, our economy and lifestyles are quite different, but I have been feeling like life is just an endless struggle.

"tired what is your reaction when people vent or tell their pathetic and sad life to you ?

like for example : they live in the street or whatever and they ask you what u would do if that was you and you’re so weak that you’re already laughing at how QUICKLY you would’ve kys in this situation ?? 😂 like you don’t even do it on purpose but u laugh because your life is objectively so much less tragic but you’re kinda like « bro I could nevaaaaah 😭💅 »…

bc i feel like this 100% of the time, i can’t do the easiest thing ? like just go out and study for more than 2 months without encountering situations that just proves me i don’t belong in this society/world ? 

i’m so so so tired but there’s a fucking thing that just tolds me i don’t deserve to die but i mean that’s a lie, everyone deserves it, especially me…

idk what to do to not suffer and not kms ? i don’t like anything anymore , i’ve been thinking the same thing since i’m 15, i don’t have a passion, don’t have a purpose, and i’m fucking angry with everyone…

i’m actually really jealous of people getting out of depression… because that’s what shows they’re normal ppl that are getting sad when something v sad happens to them.

it’s not my case, i don’t like this world and i don’t wanna live in it.

idk it makes me sick to see ppl wake up everyday to do things i will never ever want to do in my life.???

like wtf you obtain by watching sunsets and walking and just wake up everyday ? it’s boring…. there’s no purpose wtf i’m so pissed rn….

sometimes i even picture myself in if i would have lived the same way as my parents and I KNOW I WOULD KILL MYSELF INSTANTLY. 

i don’t picture myself to be happy, ever.

i even have a boyfriend for 3 years now and i’m even more sad. 

the only thing that makes my life a little better is drugs music porn alcohol and sex (and since i have a boyfriend sex is so boring and even now that we are in a open relationship i don’t even have the motivation to see people) 

i used to live for flirting with guys before, i really had nothing else that made me feel good…

now idk… i just feel like a depressive person going through a depression ?sometimes i can’t even get out of bed to roll a joint bc i have no strength…

i dropped out of school a lot and i have nothing to offer to this word (officially, bc unofficially i know i’m smart, i know how to help people, i could have made myself useful but 1) ppl don’t let me show them, bc i have no diplomas or anything to show them my worth 2) even tho ppl want me somewhere i end up burn out int and disappearing bc deep down i don’t wanna live this life. PERIOD)

also i have a very strong sense of value and i find so fucking pathetic the fact that anyone can just THINK they’re smart and could be useful while being actually just a loser all their life. 

as an example my boyfriend which is even dumber than me is always thinking he can be rich and can enter any school (thanks to me he knows he  set his expectations too high) but he believes he can get rich af without KNOWING A SINGLE NOTION IN FINANCE OR BUSINESS COURSES ??? (he doesn’t even have a GED equivalent at 22 and their friends and even parents says « thinking is not his specialty »)

like wtf that’s why i’m also so mad at him, bc he’s disposed to be a loser but unlike me he’s happy like a fucking moron ??? 

idk that’s just too much, now he wants to go live abroad. AND GUESS WHAT.
that stupid moron never ever thought about that in his entire life so he doesn’t know any other cultures or languages except our (french) and he still thinks he can get a job in a country like Singapore Canada Switzerland The US ?????!!!!

anyway he’s a pure reflection of how much my life is a disaster. 

mentally he is the opposite of what i’ve ever wanted and supported ? 

even politically he’s just following the trends, he believes what anybody says as long as it’s in a video….

anyway i wanna die but i don’t even hate him enough to do that to him.

i feel pity for him but i’m the one who’s sad wtf"
"Dealing with health anxiety for years... and how Im learning to move on from it Im no expert and I know everyone is different but I’ve come a long way with my health anxiety and wanted to share a little of what I learned.  
(On mobile, excuse format and typos)

I once read something along the lines of “our brain believes everything we tell it, so if we start filling it with doubt and anxiety, we create a world that is simply not true” 

A year ago and I was telling myself every little symptom meant imminent death, I worried about brain cancer, breast cancer, blood cloths, etc etc etc. 

Im still in the process of completely desensitize myself from the most minimal sensations and Im still trying to learn how to really understand what my body is trying to tell me, this is kind of how I learned to deal with it (again, I know not everyone is the same but hopefully this will be useful for someone) 

1. If I can distract myself from the sensation or discomfort then its anxiety, I call them “sensations” because any little thing I feel I wanna convince myself is pain even if its not. I try to ignore it if thats the case. My doctor always told me small sensations or symptoms are not a sign of anything serious.

2. If its interrupting your day to day then take something for your symptom and try to move on, (eg., you have a sore throat then get something specifically for that) 

3. If over the counter meds don’t do it and its well over a week or so then I’ll call my Doctor explain whats going on and see if I can come in for some answers and peace of mind. 

If you have multiple terrible symptoms then of course go check with your doctor asap. But the main thing is, breathe friend. Don’t freak out immediately, don’t google about it, try to accept the thought and the sensations as exactly that, thoughts and sensations and nothing more, they’re not a sign of anything. 

Ironically, life is not guaranteed for anybody no matter what, but looking for symptoms constantly means you’re wasting something you want to hold on to so desperately. 

Think about that, I do it everyday. "

"Lamictal and delayed period? Any correlation? I recently got back on lamictal 3/14, I was supposed to get my period a few days ago and so far still nothing. From what I remember the last time I was on lamictal I never had an issues with it affecting my period but things could be different this time around. Has anyone with a uterus experienced a delay in their period as a side affect of lamictal?"
"The fear just keeps getting worse and I need some advice Hi all,

I've had health anxiety ever since I was a little kid,but this past month I have  been unable to manage it anymore.I know that what I feel and fear is irrational and improbable, but I can't seem to make myself truly believe this.
Instead, I just keep googling and freak myself out constantly.


The past month I've been very paranoid about pregnancy(which is irrational in itself my last sexual contact was in october, and the circumstances made 
 pregnancy very unlikely),after PCOS treatment completely fucked up my cycles.Two weeks ago, I had an ultrasound to ease my mind and everything came back negative, which relaxed me for a while.But now I can't stop worrying about an ectopic pregnancy that could rupture at any moment and kill me.The doctor only checked my uterus and ovaries,and because of this I worry that  she could have missed it if it  was ectopic.I've been having a lot of cramps and spasms, pain that goes from my neck to my shoulder and a couple weeks ago I had an episode of really bad sharp abdominal pain that I attributed to bad nutrition and stress.

I know this probably sounds crazy, but I can't shake the thought that there's a ticking time bomb inside of me.I'm really panicked and I just want to move on.How do I deal with this?"
"just some thoughts for you be patient with yourself.
its okay to say no. YOU are experiencing your life. nobody knows how you feel. your feelings are valid and its okay to set boundaries. its okay if you can‘t do it today. it takes a lot of energy for you to always fight against your worries and anxiety. so its totally understandable if you need some space and peace. 

dont surround yourself with people that drain your energy. its okay to let them go. this gives you more energy to focus on the good people and things in your life.

i hope you have a good day today. but also dont have too much expectations. its totally fine if not everything is going to work out today."

"the past nine months have been a struggle. i force myself to sleep so that i do not have to feel the feeling of being numb but I am tired all the time. i wish the thoughts would just stop. i long for a moment of clarity, a moment ofpeace, a moment of silence. i have no support system. everyone tells me to get over it or that i have no reason to be sad. i hate feeling this way. i miss the person i was a year ago, it feels like that version is so far out of reach. i got put back on my meds today. i feel like such a failure."
"I have been feeling depressed since the pandemic started. Back then I was at least productive and now I just feel what is the point. I have been living in a good city basically my whole life. I never once had a night out or did anything because I wanted to be a ""good kid"". Once I did my boards I thought I could finally let go and chill for a bit and finally live a little but the pandemic shitted all my plans. I was planning to take a gap year after I graduated to finally enjoy my life a bit but I recently found out my dad is getting transferred to some village and we have to move. I just feel like I have wasted my life trying to fit in the mold of a ""good kid"". I have been here all my life and making friends does not come easy, I just fear I will be lonely all my life. I used to have morning walks that gave me some relief but I cannot do that because of rain. I feel very suffocated. I am also under a lot of pressure because my dad thinks I will get into one of the top law colleges. Please offer me some advice and do not suggest therapy or treatment because it is a huge stigma here. I need some guidance please. I need guidance and help"
Honestly I am depressed af lol. The suicidal thoughts have calmed down a little only because I have not been sober for one day. I do not think actually for a hour . I have been drinking to drink myself into a coma tbh. Sadly has not worked cuz I am still here. Something rlly bad happened to me that crushed my soul and inknow I will not be the same anymore but everyone thinks I am being dramatic but I am not. This is the lowest I have been. I wish I would stop waking up tbh. Depressed af

"I am pathetic, I have been addicted to masturbation and porn since I could remember and I cannot even get an erection with actual women. I am not nervous or anything, I just cannot. I just broke a streak on no masturbating for almost two days and I feel sick of myself. I like the idea of finding a partner that I can experience life with, but I do not want someone to be with when I cannot even preform. that is not fair to them, and eventually they will get fed up with me too. I do not even know how Id bring it up to someone I am interested in. I do not feel like a man. Plus I have blood pressure issues so I am trying to tackle those. I just feel like Ill never be cured.

"I have never been one to identify with suicide or anything like that but time and again this week the thought has really been pushing itself on me. I do not want to carry on anymore. I woke up this morning and my first instinct was to go back to bed, this is following around a 4 day period when I have not left my bed. My life has just fallen apart recently and not for the first time. I am intensely sensitive to rejection and that in turn makes people reject me as I scramble to make small things better my actions get desperate and it pushes people away.Here is where my life currently is. My house mates are being toxic as all hell. they have forced me to move out and in the waiting period they have ignored me or been vocally dismissive of me when I am in there presents. Going as far as to invite a full party of people I know over and then getting angry when I wanted to come in and talk to them. When I have tried to get in touch with these people they have clearly been turned against me so I do not really have any friends at the minute.I lost my job a few days after they asked me to move out so on top of having no income I also need to move back in with my parents who while being nice, they are very negative people who want to spend all the time complaining, they also have a life style that brings trouble to the house quite a lot so it leads to me having to have to be out numbed in physical confutations (when I hate violence) or helping a sibling out of a suicide attempt (two examples of real things that happened on my life 2 month period of living with them).This girl I was seeing and getting very coupley with, the first girl I have had romantic interests towards in over 3 years has called it off because she is confused. I have accepted it but she is a very flirty person (which is fine its the person I fell for), and at social events she is very over the top with people which I was always fine with but I can tell it now makes her feel uncomfortable acting herself in the situations around me. She now seems uncomfortable when I make any comment that other peoples would be fine and she actively avoids me unless its just the two of us.No friends, no job, no partner, no prospects to improve any of the situations and make to feel uncomfortable everywhere I go. Its not the first time my life has fallen apart like this. And people wonder why my confidence has dropped so much over the last few years. My first instinct is to go back to bed"
This age has to be like this blablablabla
"I originally typed a whole thing about my past mental health diagnosis but its really unimportant. Well anyways, I just wanted to talk about a day, rather a moment, I had earlier this week. I was going insane from boredom and left my house to run some errands, ended up in a few shops for some of my interests and had some nice talks with total strangers. Idk just a few hours doing things I have not done in a while what I noticed was I got home. Ate a snack and walked to throw the trash out going though my backyard. The sun was out and I felt warm, I hummed a song that I listened to in the car earlier. I stopped for a moment and holy shit I felt good! I mean good? it was weird almost surreal. I felt pretty much high in that tiny moment. I am at a loss per words in describing it, it was not joy, or even happiness I just felt momentary comfort, relaxation maybe a feeling I may come across 1x a year. I cannot imagine it again now, and I feel insane. I just cannot shake the thought Is this what I am supposed to feel? Not sure if I am depressed, but I do know I am never happy"
"i was doing very well for some time now. probably since early spring. no clue what set me off. i have not been enjoying my new job much, but that is not a new feeling (took the job in january). i woke up tired today. as the day went on, my ability to focus on work and maintain my motivation to get through the work day quickly deteriorated. by dinner, i had no plans of eating (managed a protein bar at lunch). this is not usual - normally i am hungry and, when depressed, i binge eat often. but my boyfriend decided to cook the meal i was meant to make us, so i did eat a healthy dinner. i then laid down in my made bed. i did not get up again. i have things to do around the house, but i cannot be bothered. they do not matter to me in the moment, but, at the same time, they do. i have anxiety about wasting time just laying here. but i cannot find a good reason to actually get up. about an hour ago, i started crying. i feel heavy and like there is low-grade electricity in my skin. i am uncomfortable. i have no idea why i feel sad.but i do know that my boyfriend otherwise ignoring me all night after dinner did not help. sure, he made the food (though he also had to eat), but then he never checked on me. he got mad that i asked him (for what was probably the millionth time in the last 6 years) not to touch my stomach when he came in to say goodnight just before he went to bed. i do not like my stomach touched and i have been explicitly clear about this to him relentlessly; he just does not care about my boundaries. because i called him out via asking him once again not to do the thing he was doing, he curtly said goodnight and left without giving me a kiss as he usually would have done. that was my punishment, i guess. he very often withholds various forms of affection and this is usual behavior for him. so, i am not surprised. and i was not surprised he never checked on me because he is also very selfish and self-centered (likely a narcissist). but i am not here to talk about him and his many problems or how these impact me. while his behavior and the way he treats me has done absolutely nothing to improve my overall mental health, i was depressed long before him and I am sure i will be long after. i was not expecting him to help today or do anything really, but brought it up because i wanted to mention still that i am nevertheless feeling disappointed that the person i care about did not give me the care that i have in the past and would have given him if our positions were reversed today. i knew he would not, but it still sucks that he did not. either way, i was already sad and do not know why. this just did not help the situation.background: depression has been a problem for most of life over the last 20 years on and off. in min my mid-30s now. its better and then its not. i can go long stretches of almost months and be completely fine; feeling cured.and then something will set me off again into a downward spiral. usually quite slowly, so i do not see it coming. but I am getting better at identifying when the symptoms are starting to onset and i can start to employ my various countermeasures. but sometimes, often really, it is tough to identify what triggers it to come back. when my depression is bad, i am insatiably hungry, tired, unfocused, unmotivated, sad (crying on and off), experience loss of interest in friends/hobbies/fun, have loss of sex drive, and i cannot sleep. this is sometimes accompanied by anxiety attacks and a one-time panic attack. anxiety is new to the party in the last 2-3 years. and its not nearly as much of an issue, but its there at times. sometimes with the depression and sometimes on its own. fortunately, i am able to force myself to work so that it has never really impacted my career. but i cannot do much else when in a depressive episode. which can last for days to months (though its been awhile since its been more than a few weeks). i live with my boyfriend, whom i love despite his narcissism (he is not all bad, i swear. he just has a lot of his own problems and has no problem putting himself first and/or being selfish). hes almost 40 and we have lived together almost 6 years and it is manageable for now as i cannot afford any other option anyway. he might not be helping my depression but he is not purposely making it worse. and that is a lot better than the last several guys. my US employer-supplied health insurance does not cover therapy and i cannot afford therapy out-of-pocket (i have researched this extensively). lethargic, low-grade anxiety, sad for no reason."
"Convinced myself I have Celiac disease? I've been lactose intolerant since I was 20, and got diagosed with GERD as a child. However I just recently did a dumb thing and looked up symptoms of celiac disease and am rationalizing going to the doctor and getting tested.

No one else in my family, even extended, has had lactose or acid problems. Eating gluten with celiacs long term can cause those problems. I've always been underweight (5'11, 130 lbs). Im also always tired, though I think my iron levels are fine and I cleared a thyroid test a few years ago. When I have more than 3 drinks in a night, I have severe vomiting the next day to the point I've gone to the ER because it had been every hour, for 8ish hours.

For someone this anxious about it, you'd think I'd track these things better. But now I'm locked into a very shitty vegetarian diet at work chock-full of products with gluten for the next 5 months. Would I be justified in going to the doctor just to lay all this out there and see if its related, maybe to celiac? Or am I just being paranoid?"
hey guy today i opened up to my boyfriend for the first time in a while about all the mental turmoil i ve been going through a part of me want to cut it off i love him dearly but i just feel like i ll be a burden to him for the rest of my life if i stay is it selfish to leave or selfish to stay if i knew he d be fine if i knew he d make it and be happy with someone else one day i would leave i would spend all the money i have chasing fleeting happiness until i m ready to go i wish i could erase the memory from his head so he can just know peace
"lithium, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, benzos--which are the most dangerous to be on long-term? Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

So I've recently been through a rough half year involving suicidal ideation, crazy mood swings, three months on disability, and two surgeries. Needless to say like has been incredibly stressful. The number of meds I'm on has grown to the following: trileptal, lithium, saphris, rexulti, klonopin, and provigil. I want to wean down so am wondering, which of these are the worst to be on long-term? Which are the safest? I need to figure out the right cocktail and I just want to get off all of them but history has shown this is not the smartest thing to do."
"I am a 21 years old female and I have moved back to one of my parents 2 months ago after finishing 6 years of psychotherapy (impatient). My main diagnosis is borderline personality disorder, but I have been diagnosed with depression as a teenager, and I believe it has returned since I have come home (so these two are comorbid now). The point is that I feel exhausted all the time. I can barely do any chores which makes me feel bad as I am unemployed (looking for work) so I cannot contribute financially either. Whenever I have the energy I always do something, but it is pretty rare. For example, now it is early in the afternoon here and I have literally just had a bath and feel like I have run 10K without any food. The reality is that I had oatmeal with berries a few hours before that and I had been in bed on my computer, so *I should have the energy.* The whole thing is even worse because I have PCOS and insulin resistance and I am about 20kgs overweight. My eating is actually quite good now but I know I should really get moving as well. I actually feel like cycling, doing yoga, body weight exercises etc. fairly often but I just do not seem to have the energy (I used to work out all the time when I was anorexic, 6 days a week, often 2 times a day). Sometimes I can barely hold my phone while mindlessly scrolling in bed. My limbs all feel weak and wasted away. I have no idea if this can be caused solely by depression or what, as this is pretty extreme I am going to. Even after spending almost all day in bed (maybe a 6K walk every second day) I can sleep up to 11 hours a day. In the past, I was unable to sleep more than 8 hours at one go. Btw I do not use any stimulants, do not drink coffee/ caffeinated tea, alcohol etc. because they worsen my anxiety. However, I usually fail to drink enough water, which I know is not useful. What is wrong with me? Any suggestions on how to break out of this? Chronic fatigue (extreme). What can I do?"
"When I am depressed, I stay silent. Unless there is a very good reason to talk, I keep my thoughts to myself and even when I do speak, its in as few words as possible. I give nothing away. When I am angry I have focus and drive and I do not take shit from anyone, in fact I actively punish people who fuck with me. I do not do anything I do not want to do and do not give a shit what people think of me because I do not need them for anything.I like myself in both of those states. I keep to myself and I never end up regretting the things I say or do. But when I am happy its like I am a different person. I hate that person. I get self conscious and make concessions for other people as a result, I overshare and tell people things Id never want them to know about me and immediately regret it every time, I just lose all the things about myself I have learned to do right over the years, all the things I actually like about myself. Its like having my brain hijacked.And people who see my like that get fooled into thinking that is who I actually am and they expect it all the time even though most of the time, that is not me at all and I do not even understand that person. And because I am not me at those times, I guess I make people think I actually want friends and then they get confused and blame me when I do not want to hang out and I secretly just want them to fuck off (which I guess *is* my fault).I just hate being happy, I hate who I become and I wish I could somehow guarantee Id never turn into that person ever again. I hate myself when I am happy"

"Unraveling my brain When I was younger, I just thought I was weird.  Quirky.  Kinky.  

Now I am realizing that all of that weirdness - everything that makes me, me - stems from a deeply unhealthy place.  And I feel shaken, and I'm questioning everything.  

Polyamorous?  Or just codependent, addicted to relationships, and unable to truly commit?

Fun loving, or just impulsive and incapable of saying no?

I want to be better, but it feels like I just act more and more crazy the harder I try.

"pent up emotions would always be creeping up in the back of my mind and could not stand myself anymore. Feeling of self-hatred is something that many people have experienced in their lives. I belittle my own self-worth because i do not believe that i deserve the life I had been given because I failed to meet the expectations of people around me and because of that, I ran away because it was much easier than confronting my problems. Other times, I see no value in myself for whatever reason and thus begin to think that i am a burden to society and the people I care about. Because of this, i start to convince myself that maybe not existing would be better and I cannot get out of this unhealthy and self-destructive mindset. I always look at the floor while walking cannot look people in the eye and I always have negative perceptions dictate so I think people will only say negative things about me. The most important thing is I never felt the meaning or value and joy of LIFE. Speech I had to do at school for an exam called Life (its about my anxiety and depression)"

Maybe, its just sad to be alone. Like no one to care how you feel, but when I know that their day is a little bit off, I tend to ask them if is there anything I can help them with. To fully understand their grief. I do not want to get back to my depressive state again, where I tried to shot myself.

"Woes of getting in as a new patient I'm just so frustrated, been off meds about a year and a half, been stable, moved to a small city and away from a crappy hospital, but away from from my established medical resources. I called the largest provider here, as of January 17th they're booked into mid April! Place I'm waiting to hear back from is *only* a couple months out, hoping to get in earlier simply because I'm already diagnosed and have records of previous medications. 

I just don't get it, yeah I should have done this sooner, but I was stable, if not slightly elevated, but I'm trying to stay ahead of this before my depression gets deadly serious (2 previous hospitalizations). The second place I called only has one Psychologist and one nurse, I forget the abbreviation but able to prescribe, however I had a bad experience last time with a similar situation, interestingly enough on my second hospitalization I was being cared for by the Dr that had the nurse as his assistant, and he was not too impressed with the meds she had has been trying, as I was not improving, she'd actually prescribed ssri for me and he explained that that is about the last thing I should be taking, anyways. 

It's just so frustrating for me, trying to get the help I need, as much as I had bad side effects from my last meds, I'd rather have them than go through this damn suicidal roller coaster again! 

Thanks for reading and letting me get some of this out. "

"17, Need professional help but not sure if parents understand that I'm 17 and male. Since last year I've constantly thought im going to have a heart attack, cardiophobia. It's really starting to get in the way. 
  
It started with bad heart palpitations and arm pain and I took multiple trips to the urgent care center and a few ekgs, and they all said I was fine. It takes me so long to fall asleep at night because of this, I get anxiety attacks often, and I've formed a habit where I need to knock on wood almost all the time to calm me down a bit (weird habit)  
  
I'm not overweight and I go for bike rides a lot but my dad is always telling me to workout because he loves working out. I tried it months ago but the fear I was going to have one multiplied and I couldn't stand feeling my heart beat. He's trying to have me do guided meditation but for some reason that makes me way more anxious than when I started. He hasn't wanted me to go to therapy because I haven't ""committed to his solutions yet"".   
I get and appreciate he's trying to help but I really wanted professional help. I went to them in tears a couple weeks ago saying please just let me get some professional help, and my mom said she'd find someone. Fast forward to today and I found out she got my a family psychologist, one that already sees my 10 year old brother (he gets very angry).   
I wanted an actual therapist, I'm not sure if it's the same thing and my mom is saying that ""he's just going to say the same things we've been saying and it's going to cost a lot""  
I'm not trying to make my parents look bad because I get they're trying to help, and my mom used to have a lot of problems with depression and anxiety when she was a teen so I'm sure she gets it, but I just dont know what the fuck I'm supposed to do anymore. Looking for any advice. I usually take my mind off it by hanging out with my friends by the campfire at night and that sort of stuff but I moved from New England to TX 3 months ago and I haven't made any close friends yet.  
I just need some advice, this stresses me out so bad every day thinking I'm going to die, please and thank you so much."
"I'm confused, Liuyu, aren't you dizzy from yesterday's plane ride"
"I'm going off meds, and I'm not telling my doc. I'm tired of the side effects and feeling like a numb lazy blob. I want to feel again. I'm going to take my gabapentin, clonidine, and smoke CBD (&lt;2% THC). But everything else is being put away. I need to be functional, not just calm. "
"I am just exhausted emotionally. I am on meds and they work for bit but then they stop. I am too embarrassed to make another appointment to get them fixed again. I feel like I am trapped in a never ending cycle. I am watching everyone around me grow up. I did not plan on making it this far so I did not make any future plans. Everyone else went to college and is graduating next summer. I have not even fucking started. Everyone else is moving out of their parents house. I cannot find a place to move to with jobs and rent I can make work. I just work a shitty cook job. And I am dumb and quit therapy. I do not know anymore. I am just in revolving door of confusion of what to do and it makes it so much worse. I do not know, I am just rambling"
goodd nightt sweet dream to everyonee jared neveerr chat on kyte lol
"come up and live with us and she'd leave me alone with him, wasted out of his mind, while she would be with her boyfriend (who shes now married to). Eventually I moved back with my dad and everything was fine. I'd call and talk to her and she sounded like she had her life together. Well then they broke up for a short period of time, and she moved to live with her half siblings. She would drink excessively, and call me and cry about her life."
"I feel lost. My life seems to be going nowhere in particular; I do not have a set path for my goals, and my parents are constantly pressuring me to do better. I love them, and I want to make them happy, and I want them to be proud of me.But I am miserable. Whether it be at work, doing classes, video games, nothing really seems to help anymore. I even delved into marijuana for a while to cope with things, but they just made things worse. I have gotten off of it since; it is been giving me major anxiety. The only time that I feel genuinely not depressed is when I am out with friends, which is only a temporary relief as they have got lives of their own, and their own stuff to do. It just feels like a temporary escape. I have talked to a doctor about my lack of initiative and my inability to focus, but they chalked it up as me being lazy, or lacking a specific goal. Maybe I am.The idea of suicide seems so relieving to me, it feels like an escape from all of my problems; but I know it is not a solution. The only time I feel at ease is when I am asleep. Waking up, I just get hit with a big dose of reality. I just feel so helpless, I do not know what to do with my life. it is getting harder to find a reason to get out of bed every day."
"I do not hate being alive. I just hate living. I feel like I cannot do anything right no matter how hard I try. I tend to mess something up in one way or another and I am just trying to survive. I drive my car trying to get from one point to another in a rural area with no public transportations, my car breaks.I drive my dads truck, and it rains, living in a hilly spot, the traction control comes on, and now the tires smell and have a white smoke coming from them, even after the traction control disengaged.I had to grocery shop and I was just trying to get the usual. I got pickles and then putting them in the truck something broke so now there pickle juice all over a 50lb bag of salts that is for our cows. Of course the bag was paper so the juice leaked through. And of course trying to get the giant box of cat little out of this truck I am not used to I smacked my lip and busted it open. These were just my blunders from this morning. The list goes onIm just tired of doing stuff. Everything I do something, bad things keeps happening and I am tired of feeling like a burden, I waste money I break stuff. And all I am trying to do is live with the same knowledge that was given to my peers. I wish I could just some doing thing and making decisions and have everything done for me. Then I could do nothing wrong. Fuck my lip hurts. I hate having to live."

"Have I been having heart attacks?! As of late I’ve been experiencing pains on the inside of my left arm and frequent sharp pain in my chest to the left of my breast plate. Sometimes the pain radiates across my chest and shoulder and other times it can be one or the other. I’ve also been experiencing rapid heart rates from little physical activity and high blood pressure. I do have pretty severe health anxiety and also suffer from digestive problems as well so I can be sure if it is just my anxiety manifesting physical symptoms. I went to the ER last week and they said the blood tests showed no signs of it being heart related but my PCP decided to have me wear a heart monitor patch for a week and that made me more conscious of my palpitations and pains. Today is first day since I’ve taken it off and sent it in. While I was eating lunch (normal meal that shouldn’t have triggered anything) I experienced hot flashes across my body and then the pains started again. Has anyone experienced similar symptoms? I’m a 24 male who is 6’,underweight and pretty malnourished right now from my stomach issues.

"bad I'm probably not as intense than anyone here idk. But i feel... Alone? Not my parents not my friend in school nobody barely caare about me. Not even talking none. I feel this heart of mine is just as empty as a loud barrel and as freezing as morning winter in the mountains. Im tired of trying, trying to make them even glance at me, i tried all the thigs i could think of such as being more talkative, pop more jokes, they do laugh but i don't feel any noteable form of relationship. 
At First i thought i could fight by myself so even if i have no mental support i could breach through life but as days come it gets worse, now everytime i think about it my neck and arm feels itchy and tingly. I don't want to die but at the same time i dont want to continue. I wish there is this option of sleeping it away forever.
Tbf why am i even writing this, what? did i think somebody gonna come and care? Ridiculous."

"Worried about tetanus. Today I was tearing apart an old wooden desk. There was one screw I was loosening and I reached out to pull the screw out when something pricked my pointing finger. 

I immediately pulled my pointing finger away and went straight to the bathroom to disinfect it with hydrogen peroxide. There was a small metal piece which had loosened from the screw and pricked me. The wound is no larger than a pinprick and it had no notable bleeding. 

Yet, here I am worried about tetanus.
Please educate me or assure me that I am going to be just fine - if you could. I am driving myself crazy."

My therapist wants me to go on anti depressants as she is drained and thinks they will put fuel in my fire as I do not seem to have any. Haunted by things I want but cannot get like a decent relationship and someone that loved me and does not further hurt me. I just cannot get my shit straight. I am scared of the anti depressants. I am scared of my depression. I live for my family and just not to put them through pain. But I just cannot make any headway. I cannot feel good about myself or think yes, I can. Only no, I cannot. I am worthless and scared of everything.I feel like I am treading water. Delaying the inevitable one day at a time. Work.. work work bloody work."

"My ex boyfriend is bipolar. asking for opinion We broke up 3 months ago. I knew form the start about his state and I tried to inform myself about his disorder so I could better reach to him. At first we met he was in relathionship and I didn't knew that. We were just acquaintances, but we liked each other. He had that conversation with me, that he likes me and that he is in relathionship with that girl for one year and I told him that he shouldn't reconsider breaking up a serious relathinship just because he likes someone (in that case me) and after that it passed one month. We didn't had contact. 

Suddenly he showed up and it looked like he broke up. He told me that he is free and that he felt nothing for that girl, so we started dating. He looked really really in love with me and I sstarted to love him. We had a great relathionship and everything went just perfect. but for one year. Than he had that ""cold waves"", we called that state like that. As he told me he had for a very long time a big problem with retrospective jelosy. Sometimes it affected on us. And sometimes he had a periods when he, as he said- felt nothing to me, but that he cared for me. I gave him space and tried to understand and wanted him to be free to make decision if he wants to be with me. And our relathionship lasted one year like that. 

He never had a relathionship longer than one year. In our case we lasted for two years. But the second one was filled with all those ""cold waves"" he felt. And the last wave when we broke up I gave him a freedom again, but it seems like now that he really choose to move on and it looks like he really don't love me. 

He made an instangram page and now after 3 months of break up he posted a photo with a new girlfriend. I can guess he behave a little bit strange and that he is just in his mood swing. But we were perfect match in everything else. We got along very well. I feel like he is my true soulmate, despite his strange behaviour. 

Now I just reconsider if he ever really loved me? And maybe I  supposed to be more dedicated and try harder to keep us together? Maybe I could do something to keep him close? But I was affraid to be intrusive with him and insisting to be together. I choose to give him freedom. Did I done the right thing? What do you think?"
"Hi, 34 m here. Posting this on my main because fuck it. This is who I am.I think I have been feeling this way for my entire life and, for a while, I was quite good at ignoring it. Alcohol also REALLY helped, but I successfully swore off that stuff two years ago and if I relapse and start boozing again I will be a lost because.They say drinking just makes your anxiety and depression worse. However, moving through life stone sober has just amplified my constant fear, hopelessness, self-doubt, and general apathy, and it getting worse. it is also incredibly boring. Although, I do not find any non drinking-related activities interesting, and even if I did, I would probably make an excuse not to participate. I do not find any activities interesting.I do not have any friends, I do not have any hobbies, and I do not have any interest in doing anything. I cannot even focus on things I enjoy, so what is the point? My mind is so muddled by fear and anxiety that If I have to do something, I just try to get it done as quickly as possible so I can go back to doing nothing. While I am doing it, I second guess myself the whole time and pretty convince myself that I cannot do it. One the task is over, I feel no relief; just disappointment and worry that I will probably have to do it all over soon after.I want to get better. I figured I would put this all out in writing tonight and then try to find a professional I can start seeing tomorrow.Wish me luck... I am going to get better"
"depression on drugs Simple question for people with depression. How do you feel on alcohol or other drugs, if so which drugs? How often do you use them? Do you believe it affects you depression in any way, long term, short term? 

I'm interested in any answer from a person who uses drugs on how it affects their depression. But particularily people who don't use them regularly: does it make you feel happiness? Does it make you feel things you miss out on in daily life? Why don't you keep using them? (of course know a lot of good reasons not to use drugs in daily life even if you're depressed, I'm just interested in the answers)"

"Every time I’m manic I want to cheat on my boyfriend I’m currently manic and I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s like this almost every time I’m manic. It’s especially bad since I’ve caught him cheating on me (more than once) so now my brain can “justify” it. I get extremely hypersexual when I’m manic and I find have my sex with someone that I’ve been having sex with for awhile extremely boring. I want new and exciting, the thrill of sleeping with someone I’ve never had sex with. I know this makes me seem like a shitty person but I just can’t stop thinking about it despite knowing how wrong it is


Edit to add: 

1.) I am not going to cheat, I am able to reason enough to know I won’t, but that doesn’t mean the thought isn’t there

2.) I had to come off of the meds I was on due to pregnancy and it being known to cause birth defects. I go see my psychiatrist again soon to get started on something pregnancy safe, he’s just been out of town

3.) Just because you personally have never experienced this feeling, does not mean it’s not a thing. Everyone’s experience with mental illness is different. I am aware that mania is not an excuse to cheat, when not manic I have no desire to seek attention or sex elsewhere 

4.) An open relationship/ ethical non monogamy is a no go for him. He’s (ironically) way too jealous for any of that and has made it very clear he has no interest in such a thing, especially anything involving me being with another person


5.) This post was not an invite to say weird creepy shit in my dms"

My depressed friend two weeks ago told me that its better for us to stop talking and asked me to stop texting her because she thinks she is toxic. After that I told her I do not find her toxic and that I am grateful for having her in my life. I went a week without talking with her at all then I talked to her at the gym as if nothing happened. Fast forward a week I texted her saying I was thinking of her since I had not seen her at the gym. She replied me normally. was it the depression clouding her mind when she asked me to not talk to her again ? Did I do the right thing ?
"questions about hypomania symptoms in general i'm really shy, i have anxiety disorder too, and as a result whenever i'm hypomanic i don't have that ""talkativeness"" symptom. i don't have anyone to talk to, and i've never approached strangers. HOWEVER i do sing, a lot, all through the night. would this be the equivalent? can anxiety override hypomania? 

i find it pretty hard to figure out my symptoms given that i'm never around other people. it's like my symptoms never reach their full potential because there's no external stimulation. does that make sense? sorry if this has been asked before."
"Is this “Anxiety”? I’ve never considered myself an anxious person.
Starting probably last week, I’ve had a strange urge/feeling to breath deep, as if to catch my breath. It’s like the feeling of turning the water on cold in the shower. Once I take that deep breath, it goes away for a bit, then usually comes back until I do it again. Yawning makes it go away as well. 

It’s weird, it feels like I am now consciously thinking about breathing (which I have never really done before). Sometimes feels like my throat is tight, and sometimes this whole thing even makes me lightheaded.

I’ve been the the doc, had an EKG, Chest X-ray, all checks out ok. Curious if I am experiencing anxiety? Is this a symptom? Any help would be appreciated!! "

"Believe me I know this is the least of everyone is worries right now compared to real problems. This is just mainly for everyone saying they cannot really enjoy video games anymore.If you are feeling depressed about not having fun with / enjoying video games as much as you used to, try not to think about the now. Try to remember WHY you enjoyed and/or fell in love with them. Is it because of how pretty or cool they can look? Is it because of the immersive / compelling storytelling? Is it because of having attachments to certain characters? Is it because they inspire you due to certain morals (again storytelling)? Is it because they do actually teach you some things, including skills you do not even think about? Or is it because they are just flat out fun?Or maybe if you are like me, it is all of the above + they make you feel like you are escaping from life in a sense. Like you are being immersed in a different world that you enjoy more than the one you have. Admittedly that is not always a good thing, because it can distract you from things you need to do if you are not careful. Or you might get TOO immersed into it that you feel a disconnect from reality. Believe me I have felt that plenty of times.Anyways the point is it is alright to get immersed into games or any other form of media really because you like it better than your current life. And maybe life is really hectic or joyless for you that it is hard to remember those fun feelings. Of course it works better for some games then others but hey. Just remember that that is just one reason to keep existing and enjoy video games in general :) For anyone not getting enjoyment from video games anymore"

"How often does y'all's anxiety cause you to actually ""feel"" symptoms of whatever it is you're currently afraid of?  Hey, so for a grand total of 2 days I've been convinced I am developing Parkinson' Disease, and after reading up on various symptoms and whatnot, I feel like I am actually starting to feel them. This is not something I've ever worried about, but now that the idea is in my head it's all I can think of.

"I’m just so scared and don’t know what to do I’m not sure how many people will read this, but I really need some help or kind words. I’m in a depressive state and haven’t had a manic episode in over two years now. (Some hypomania but nothing too concerning).

I’ve been having a hard time with work recently. After finding this community I’ve discovered that I’m not the only one with trouble holding down a job. 

I have a relatively high paying job for my area that allows me to live at least paycheck to paycheck with one pay period worth in my savings. I guess I don’t really know where to start, but I just can’t work my job anymore. I have this horrible depression and the job itself is very difficult. I have FMLA for my mental health and can take up to 2 days off per week and also have time off for appointments. I’m finding myself needing more and more time off, unpaid, and I don’t know what to do.

I applied for a much lower paying job, but I feel like it will be much better for my mental health.

I’m just so upset and defeated, I don’t know if I’ll start this new job in a good mental state, if I even get it.

I’ve considered short term disability because I just feel like I can’t stand a single more day working my current job. I just want to cry the whole time. I feel like such a failure.

I’m looking into doing a year longDBT program. It was recommended by both my therapist and psychiatrist.

I’m just having such a hard time making decisions. I know I need to leave this job. I feel like my body and mind is screaming out for help. It’s causing me physical symptoms like nausea and vomiting, migraines, panic attacks.

Please if you have any advice at all, I will appreciate it."

"Anxiety over appetite loss. I’ve been feeling very flat like depressed lately along my anxiety, like literally I can just cry and it’s hard for me to want to get out of bed. I’ve been taking lexapro for a while and I believe it stopped working. New psychiatrist added 30 mg of mirtazapine with that. I felt like it was helping at first but now I don’t feel it is. I’m meeting with him next week. I feel hungry but I have no appetite, I have to force myself to eat and that’s giving me more anxiety because I have no appetite. Like nothing sounds good, and when I start eating something nothing is sparking that “oh this tastes good I want more” and it’s giving me anxiety and scaring me. It also takes me forever to eat because of it, like I mean forever I feel like I’m just chewing and chewing when I’m usually a fast eater so that’s giving me anxiety. I’m finding that the thought of eating because of that is giving me anxiety and I’m scared that this isn’t normal."
"I do not have any friends or anything and I am so sad about it. And there was a girl talking to me, telling me that she loves me and all and it made me feel a little bit better. I wanted her to be in my life, I wanted to hug her, kiss her. I thought that she can be my safe haven, my escape from all the madness. But, long story short, she was not very loyal :) And this actually made me feel even worse. I already feel so like a subhuman and imagine, there is a girl I once loved so much and a guy can just, just fuck her if he wants to (I do not think she fucked him yet but I am not sure). Can you fucking imagine how fucking inferior I feel to him? Like, he is stepping on me, laughing at my face and.... I just, it is impossible to describe how it feels. it is awful.But she is everyone I have, I go to her whenever I am sad and want to talk about it. I do not have anyone to seek comfort in, I do not know, I mean yes I know I have to cut her out but I just cannot. I am extremely lonely and I do not know how to cut that one person out of my life"

"Escitalopram and risperidone I’ve been on escitalopram 10 and 20mg for about 7 years now. Tried to quit last year and it went SO horribly i started back at 20mg but my psych feels weak and sensitive compared to before stopping. I have agoraphobia and panic disorder. I finally saw a psychiatrist who prescribed risperidone but i’m scared as hell to take it. I had full body dyskinesia after taking metoclopramide a while back and after i saw that risperidone can cause that as well as tardive dyskinesia I’m terrified. 

Do you guys have any insight?"

"Zoloft Postpartum Anxiety I am 3 months postpartum and my doctor just prescribed me Zoloft 25mg. I have been having horrendous anxiety and insomnia. I finally decided I needed to do something about it. I took my first dose last night and was shakey and nervous and couldn’t sleep. So I took a hydroxyzine but that didn’t really help. So today I decided to take it earlier to see if that will help. I took it at noon. I am feeling so awful. Having diarrhea, which I guess I don’t really care about. But I have a headache and am soooo foggy. Like I feel weird and out of it and so tired but at the same time nervous and amped and I know I wouldn’t be able to sleep. Someone please tell me this gets better and it’s worth it. I can’t seem to see the light at the end of the tunnel right now. I have a baby that I have to care for so i hate feeling like this. I'm thinking about trying unisom tonight to sleep. Also I am breastfeeding."

so i had a really really rough childhood growing up my parent were abusive to me and i lived in an area where i got into a lot of fistfight trying to make it to the next day wa the hardest battle i attempted suicide by trying to hang myself when i wa i think the attempt failed however it left me with some minor brain damage i have a very difficult time trying to remember thing and think about thing sometimes at time it feel like i can t even read english it just doesn t click with me i ll sit and stare at it for like minute at a time before i finally understand it a for the memory issue i have a difficult time recalling some thing that have happened i will completely forget about something that happened say minute ago that most people would instantaneously remember anyway so i ve been feeling extremely strange lately i moved away from my parent after i turned and now i live in a completely different state and i am doing much better but i feel like i m still there i feel the aura of my childhood house it felt heavy if that make sense something keep weighing me down i m also smelling food that aren t being cooked food that i used to eat when i wa there i smelled a very strong scent of digiornio s pizza earlier but nobody here wa cooking it i ve also been sleeping in through the day and waking up at night so this weird feeling is intensified by like 0 time everything feel so dreamlike and liminal i can t tell the difference between reality and fiction anymore why doesn t anything feel real am i wrong to distrust my eye ha anyone else felt this way it would bring me great comfort to know that i am not alone
"Can someone help me? I am really confused and kind of scared. I am breathing really hard and it will not stop. I cannot sit still.

Can someone help me?"
"You know what I really hate ? it is when you lower your expectations so much , yet you are always hit with a new level of surprise. You start making excuses for your dearest: "" It just happens that my lows catch them on their busy time"" , and I understand really well that I am not entitled to anyone's support (not financially or anything , just a simple cheering up), but this simply cannot keep happening , especially since , in my case , even when I try to distance myself because of the feeling of betrayal , they always comeback when they are in their lows , and I simply never turn an eye on that because up until recently I thought that is the norm , yet time goes by and the same circle repeats itself. We all have problems because sure life is a bitch , but it is just so much harder that the moment you are ready to fight them , just the knowledge that the people you thought would be there are not , you lose your footing to a scary degree. I have always overcame my depressive episodes , but doing it for ""myself"" is not going to work forever. I have caught on hobbies , stayed away from any kind of addiction , focused on my carreer , but none of them seem to work long term , simply because this is a personal battle , never have I had one single suicidal thought that I could brush off with : oh but you will never be a world class guitarist or artist if you do so. Those make a great way to pass time , and change the perspective too , but they do not stop it from happening. At least not for me. I really want to learn to love life , I appreciate so many things , the strays that come for petting , and as much as I know the next lound sound going to scare them , at this point I could almost count on them more than I count on people. I am just tired of all of this. I am sorry for the long post this is was just something I needed to get out of my chest. there is something sinister in being used to feeling abandoned"

But the medical industry i.e. the psychologist and psychiatrist thrive off this because it gives men purpose and it is designed to control the population so we do not engage in the act of reproduction.Pick your poison money or god - eventually both sides will steal your hard work because both sides are great at stealing but not good at creating original ideas because they have killed off their feelings by either doing drugs or smoking.

"buspar higher dose wondering about people experiences going up to higher doses of buspar (im on an ssri too)...ive been at 15-20mg/day for years- but still not 100% sure it really helps that much when my anxiety is bad. and its really bad lately- want to avoid benzos, but seriously need some extra relief. 

so im wondering is going up to 30-60mg that much different than lower doses or maybe i should look into something else.

"Question about seroquel Hi everyone. I'm not sure if there is a better place to ask this. I'm not bipolar but I am prescribed seroquel which I know is common for bipolar so maybe someone here has some advice or info 

I am on 150mg/day of seroquel. Been on that dose i believe for about 8 months. I was also in a car crash around the same time I started on this dose, prior to that I was taking 25mg every few days for sleep. 

I've noticed since then that I am having awful muscle aches and pains. I noticed it in my back first and got physio thinking it was from the car accident (which wasn't a bad accident but I didn't know what else it could be). The physio helped some but I'm noticing other muscles are hurting a lot, every day. My right arm will get numbness a fair amount and extreme pain. I'll also have random areas (eg. Lower leg) that will start hurting for a day then go away. Is this common? Could it be the seroquel? I want to come off it but not sure how fast I can do so. 

Any help would be very appreciated! "

"After dwelling inside and not leaving my house for over 3 weeks, I went out walking at this nice summer night, and as I got home, I felt incredible euphoria, peaking around a few minutes ago and slowly fading away now. All of the loneliness and anxieties and pain are about 80% decreased and I am actually filled with a feeling of motivation and momentum, something I have not felt in a very long time. This is honestly the happiest I have been this entire year I believe. I just got high from a walk outside."

"I was a depressive alcoholic for the last couple of years, though I was still able to function and work and be responsible enough to get by, when I told my family I was a drunk(East Indian background and traditional) they hoped me well and said they love me but they did not want to associate with me until I got my depression and alcoholism and life in general order because they are embarrassed what my relatives would think if they found out about my issues.They stopped talking to me, my siblings stopped talking to me as well when they found out I was an alcoholic. I never really had many friends in life I can rely on either. I reached out to a few acquaintances but ultimately after a few kind words they stopped talking to me. 2 years later, after extensive therapy and AA work I am better and have a better job, I am more fit and generally happier. I have also had an easier time making friends and getting dates through online apps. However I noticed I still do not trust any of these people, because I always remember deep down when I needed help the most and someone to just talk to, the only help I got was myself, so I am jaded because I do not trust people to be there for me anymore, not when I really need them. I just wanted advice, how do I overcome this cynicism, even therapy has not been helping with it. 27 M that got his depression under wrap after many years but still slightly traumatized and distrustful because the only person that got me through it was me."

Hi my names jay I am feeling depressed I have been feeling like this for quite a while I am feeling down
"I am a high school senior and have been introverted my entire life, and never really minded having a small friend group or being alone. But recently I have just suddenly grown discontent with the way my life is. I feel isolated and lonely even when I am with others, and I am constantly struck with the feeling that I have been this way for so long, that there is no possibility of change. To cope, I have been trying to throw myself into my work just to make myself forget a little about all this, but I have lost the motivation to do anything. All I do nowadays is lie down and stare into space until I start to cry again. I am also trying my hardest to make more friends, or go out a little more but even then I still come home every night and cry, going to bed clutching my hands together just to try and feel some human warmth, any sense of connection. I just want to love, and be loved back by somebody. To be understood, and most of all, to connect emotionally. I would seek professional help, but I am afraid that my parents or other people will think that I am faking it, or just craving attention. Its all so sudden."

"Did I have a panic attack? About a month ago I (F 25) had (what I think) was a panic attack. I’ve gone through childhood physical and emotional abuse and traumatic events in adult hood (family member has tired to take their life a few times) but I have resisted the idea of getting professional help for myself since I was 11/12 and have only opened up about 90% with my long term boyfriend.

In 2017 I was at an all time low and was feeling like life wasn’t worth it and felt numb to the world. One night after going for dinner with work friends I was walking home and collapsed on the ground. I was conscious but felt so numb my body and mind just gave up there and then. Some people came to help me and called an ambulance for me. When the paramedics arrived the shook me and got me on a bed I didn’t talk but could hear them. I suddenly snapped out of it when they rolled me into the ambulance and started crying. The paramedic pricked me with a needle on my finger to test me for something. It hurt and was unexpected. They said they had to take me to the hospital to check me out but I was sure in my head that nothing was physically wrong with me. I got to the hospital and was so embarrassed and ashamed that I told staff I should leave and I went home. I was so incredibly embarrassed and ashamed and still am. How dare I just let all that happen when I wasn’t an emergency and what if someone somewhere needed help and was dying. I just don’t understand why didn’t snap out of it. 

Fast forward to a month ago. I was at first aid training (ironically) and that machine that pricks your finger was brought out to show us. The instructor used it on his own hand. I remembered immediately what I had done in 2017 and all the feelings of shame, guilt, embarrassment came rushing back. I didn’t think much of it and we moved onto what the readings of the blood would tell you. I suddenly started feeling my hands sweat and a hotness covered my hands and seemed to radiate throughout my whole body and face. I was taking notes and my hand became so weak I couldn’t keep writing. Then I realised my hands were shaking uncontrollably. At this point I was thinking it was in my head but then my heart started racing sooo incredibly fast. I was still sure it was in my head as all I could think about was that I’m not someone who faints at the sight of blood. Then I started feeling like I was going to faint and to my embarrassment I had to stick my hand up and say in-front of the class I was not feeling well. I got up and staggered outside the room and sat on a chair. The instructor followed me , clearly concerned. I then started thinking I was having a heart attack and was about to die. I genuinely started thinking what is everyone going to think if I die right here, my boyfriend, my family. I was telling the instructor that I don’t normally faint and that I felt weird and that my pulse was fast. The instructor took my pulse and told me to slow my breathing (hadn’t even noticed how fast and heavy I was breathing). Soon as he told me that I started calming down and thought if he’s not worried about me dying then maybe I’m not. I started feeling much better after that. At the end of the class he said he reckons it was ‘a little bit of anxiety’. 

Was that a panic attack? Whatever it was it scared me. Since then I’ve had 6 more with varying degrees but the first was the worst. This has pushed me to tell my doctor I need to speak to someone as I’m scared it’s going to happen in public and now I’m being referred to therapy so I’m not diagnosed with anything yet so am clueless. Sorry for the long post."
"I met a guy from Tinder three months ago and I like him a lot. He says he feels the same, but he does not show it. Were both in our late twenties and both want a serious relationship. He confessed he was feeling depressed and that is why we never see each other (5 or 6 times within 3 months), why he takes hours to answer messages while always online, why he is not more involved in the relationship. He was not like that at the beginning, and I am not sure if he was already feeling down at that time or not. I have been having difficulties trusting people (because of one past relationship) and I am not sure I believe him 100%, although I really want to. I also really want to keep him in my life and start getting more serious. How can I support him, especially so early in the relationship and considering the fact that he cannot give me the relationship I want? He says he cannot offer me consistency, that he could make it work one day and lack desire to do so the next. I have no idea what to do and how to do it. Helping my depressed date"
"Maybe I am just getting bad again, but... Why are the days just slipping away? One bleeds into another with nothing to show for. they are all so foggy and nothing ever happens. It seems the only thing I ever do is Work, clean, barely sleep and eat. Even on my days off, it seems nothing happens except cleaning.it is so boring and mind numbing to repeat this cycle every day. I want to be happy and feel some kind of excitement, but I am so tired and fogged in the head that I cannot do anything about it.Surely there is more to life than this? Am I really supposed to do this cycle every day until I retire or keel over? Is this really what life is supposed to be?"

"I am going to share with you something that has always cheered me up and calmed me down whenever I get really anxious over my health So this sub only seems to really have posts from users describing their symptoms and trying to get diagnosed on Reddit, now if that helps you with your anxiety that's cool, however it can be counter intuitive as the whole googling and obsessing over symptoms is the actual problem we all came here to rid ourselves in the first place. So I honestly do believe we should move more away from ""I have x,y,z symptoms am I going to die?"" to ""How can I find peace of mind and stop googling"" 


One thing I do to get peace of mind is watch this episode of [Hey Arnold](https://www.wco.tv/hey-arnold-season-2-episode-5-monkey-business-2) which is my all time favourite show (it's only the first episode in the video provided called 'monkey business' btw), I won't ruin it for you all, but it's really funny and will hit home for all of us, it highlights how silly we can be sometimes when we think we have a really bad illness and start obsessing over symptoms. Hopefully it can help you all in your journey in controlling your hypochondria like it has done for me.

Well I have another scenario to raise you....Has anyone ever made sure no one touches you for 3 days and make you not enter the kitchen and make you wash your clothes and bowls separately and not even hand food to you directly but instead place it on a nearby table for you to pick it up because they might accidentally touch you or say they cannot reheat food in a bowl you already touched because it is impure to bring it back into the kitchen and scream at you for sitting to close to other people, therefore accidentally brushing up by them, making them impure as well?No?

I have had 4 attempts on my life this year and I feel like only one time I was not fully serious about it, the other three times were serious attempts and the feeling afterwards is so shameful, and embarrassing.How do I get the nasty voice out of my head telling me to keep trying to die? it is not always there but when it comes I cannot get out of it, I do not end up feeling sad, just numb... And then I do something really dangerous. Is it because I have made it a self fulfilling prophecy to not live to see next year? How much longer do I have to cry every day? I had a therapist come over today but it was really weird because we could not hear each other properly through our masks. Self harm/suicide vent"
i would like to.
"Typically this involves simply leaving the building inside the dream. If I can find a door and get out, the dream goes away. Sometimes I wake up at this point, and sometimes I don't, but I always remember it the next morning. Has anyone else been able to ""escape"" from your nightmares in a similar way? I hope this is helpful for some."
"Does anyone have an autoimmune illness or fibromyalgia? I have bipolar NOS and ADHD. I'm suffering from extremely bad joint pain as well as other more minor symptoms- blood in my urine, hair loss, canker sores, cold urticaria, raynauds. Doc has diagnosed me with fibromyalgia so far. 

I'm wanting to hear other people's experiences with bipolar and autoimmune/fibro. What were you diagnosed with? What was the diagnostic process like? How are you managing now? Thanks!"
Tardive diskinesia Talk to me about tardive diskinesia. Do you/have you had it? Were you able to get rid of it? Does it ever get better or does it get worse with time?
"Suddenly really confrontational? So I have yet to meet with my psychiatrist to confirm my diagnosis but it's looking quite likely that I'm living with bipolar II. 

Over the past few months I've experienced my first full-blown manic episode, with all the characteristic symptoms. 

Now I'm back in a really bad depressive state. Nevertheless, I've really been treated like shit over the past few months by some people who were once friends. In the past, I'd have been very meek and mild and probably would have let such behaviour slide. But over the past month or so, I've been very confrontational about the way I've been mistreated. 

I also went to the annual general meeting of a society I used to be president of, and called them out for their causal homophobia, misogyny, racism etc. 

These are things I wouldn't have considered doing in the past - I'd have been far too anxious and frankly conflict avoidant. Now that fear has gone and I see willing to embrace confrontation when I've been wronged. 

Is this just a sign of personal growth or have others experienced a surge in confrontational behaviours as well?

Thanks guys and love to you all"

@Starrybluesky Hello back at ya and Thank you!
"This was about 4 years ago but I still think about it today. This is when I first started getting really depressed and was bad at hiding it. My mum has been through a lot in her life and it lead her to being severely depressed and mentally unstable. Stop feeling sorry for yourself all the time I do not know what her intention was with this comment, as if I had just stubbed my toe and she was tired of me complaining, but it lead to more then a little damage. Denial of my emotions, self hatred, ashamed of what I think and resentment of my own flawed mind. Also the implication I am the only one that feels bad from this pain, she does not feel a morsel of sadness her child is going through the pain she herself has felt. that is the thing though, she does not think I am in that much pain, I cannot feel even close to the pain she has felt because her life is one big endless bout of disappointment and even if I have had told her I had more similar experiences then knew, I know she would still think I am in less pain because that is just how her brain works. My mum told me to stop feeling sorry for myself"
"Already on meds, already in therapy, already have safety plansstill violently depressed, self harming &amp; cutting, generally hopeless. Honestly, if I am not killing myself, what is the point of spending time in a psych wing? Ill lose my job, potentially be detained for a long period of time, and face the public stigma of being insane. Where do you draw the king between just pushing through and locking myself away? Is there a point to psychiatric holds?"

AMA Not ask me anything... against medical advice I took half my Latuda dose a couple days ago to see if it would give me more energy. News flash I slept horribly and have been feeling the effects ever since. Not sure if this is leading to depression or what because I rarely get depressed episodes but I cried and obsessed over the stupidest things yesterday. Anyone know if this is possible just from reducing one dose?
"Want to go off meds without getting divorced I want to go off of my meds. I’ve been on them for years but they are not helping enough anymore. I’ve gone off lithium before and that went fine. I tried going off Invega but I couldn’t keep my shit together. If I get the chance again, I’ll probably just lie to get off finally. I like lamictal but it has a lot of sideffects so I’d like to get off of that too. I love my sleep med roserum. I got off of and had really bad withdrawal from lorazepam but it helps my major panic issues. So I’d keep that but use it sparingly.

My husband said he’d seriously consider divorcing me if I go off of my meds. I’m kind of devastated. We were together before I got diagnosed and medicated. We never had a bad relationship while I was off meds. I did some stupid shit occasionally but we got though it more easily than a lot of the shit I’ve done medicated. 

He drank like a fucking fish, got increasingly violent and acted like I shot him when I said I’d divorce him if he didn’t stop. He was sober 1 month. 1. And while infinitely better, still has episodes of drinking way too much. And I’m supposed to take it with a fucking smile.

But how fucking dare I say I want to get off the stuff that give me side effects I don’t want to live with anymore. I’m even open to other medication, just not what I’m on currently, except maybe lamictal.

I feel like a god damned zombie. I don’t want to die I just don’t want to live like this anymore."

I finally managed to give myself diabetes after years of trying and now that I have done that I decided to smoke as many cigarettes and use as much dip as I possibly can everday to hopefully give myself cancer I have to have it how could I not I am already a worthless disgusting fucking monster so the sooner I get cancer the better and no I am joking in the slightest I wish I had the balls to blow my brains out but since I do not I do everything I can everyday to get myself closer to death
By all accounts I should be dead right now. The amount of pain and hardship I have been through is not something that I can just live with. Basically any kind of normal life for me is out of the question. Despite me being depressed 24\7 I am just not in the mood to end it. What the hell? Why do I still want to go on?
I finally have a baking sheet for making bread whheheh I didn't buy an oven
Topamax side effects I have been on it for over 6 months and I've lost so much hair. I got off other meds thinking it was the problem but it's still happening. I looked it up last night and it seems to be a big issue with some. So I decided I'm stopping it because I hardly have any hair left. It's awful. Anyone else experienced hair loss?
"Positive thinking for others whose HA is cancer based (the what ifs) So my health anxiety is almost entirely grounded in cancer. Today I’m worried about lymphoma and brain cancer. A month ago it was lung and digestive cancer(s). Before that leukemia and before that bone cancer. You get the gist. 

My dad was diagnosed with cancer and did pass away from it. Before you freak out, he was older, active but poor poor diet his whole life. History of alcoholism. I mention this because it’s good context for my issues. My health anxiety spirals every year around this time (Jan-Mar) when he was sick. 

Even though I know many many statistics, about age of diagnosis and general health and this and that, it doesn’t always stop the worrying, as many of you are well aware. 

I tend to catastrophise. If I feel bad, it must be cancer, and since it’s cancer, I’ll die a painful death in a couple months. 

I typically avoid cancer stories as they trigger me up pretty badly (duh) but today I stumbled across a story of a 27 year old guy who was diagnosed with a rare brain cancer a few months ago. Today he announced he was cancer-free. 

The world isn’t perfect, and it isn’t always fair. There are lots of what ifs. But I think it’s so so so important to remember the what ifs are conjecture and NOT fact. 

So you go through the thing, your lymph nodes are swollen. You’re probably a little sick with a cold, or maybe you’ve been poking your neck non stop for weeks to check. So you probably don’t have lymphoma. Okay, but what if you do? Honestly, you’d probably be fine. This is not ALWAYS the case. But if we go by percentages, 99% of your worries are not cancer, or malignant, or serious at all. 75% of that 1% of real and serious conditions respond well to treatment. There’s variance but this is a great time in history to have cancer. Treatments are so plentiful and effective. Maybe you DO have brain cancer, but so? That 27 year old kid did. He’s alive and well. 

To be abundantly clear, I think it’s most important to challenge false conclusions, first and foremost. Challenge your worries. If you’re in a rut though, and you just can’t shake the feeling that “THIS TIME is has to be cancer, I just know it has to be”: stay optimistic! We are a community of worriers. Challenge yourself to think of best case scenarios, even if they’re within the worst case. 

I’m here with you, if you’re scared of something today. And I’m so positive that we will get through it just fine, I want you to be positive of that as well :)"

"Blood(???) in Stool Alright so this is an issue I’ve had on and off for years and I don’t know what to do. So basically, sometimes I have red spots in my stool. I say spots because it doesn’t fill the whole bowl, the whole stool isn’t red, just red spots. It also appears on my toilet paper time to time. I’m 21 now, and the first time anything happened was probably 5 years ago. Doctor did an occult test, found nothing but a hemroid, sent me on my way with a cream and I was fine for a while. It’s happened on and off since then and usually I either know it’s hemroids or I can trace it back to something red I ate. Recently however, it’s gotten worse. About a month ago, as my semester was ending there was about a week where I had stomach pains and twice in that week my stool had these red spots. I went to a local walk in clinic and had another occult test done and it also came back nevative. The doctor said it was probably something I ate. I’ve been fine this past month, but I just flew back from Europe and twice in the past 3 days I’ve noticed the same red spots. Now each time it happened I had a red fruity drink the day before so I still don’t really think it’s blood, but if that’s the case wouldn’t it appear as a liquid in the bowl and not a “spot” as I’ve described. 

Part of me wants to go to the doctor but I was just verified a month ago that it wasn’t blood, and I feel going again will just lead to the same result. I’m just wondering is it normal to have any redness in your stool once in a while from food and I’m just overly vigilante, as health anxiety definitely has made me, or is there more to it. Thanks for reading."

"Wellbutrin in conjunction with other meds Hi everyone, first post in this sub. My pdoc has prescribed Wellbutrin for depression, which I am taking together with 900mg Lithium, 100mg Sertralin and 1,5 mg Risperidone. Has anyone been on this combination? I started taking it on Friday, and I am a mess. Zero appetite, shaking, cold sweats, hot sweats, all the sweats. basically I am white-knuckling it till Monday when I can call the doc, but am feeling pretty alone right now and would appreciate any advice you might have. Would you for example consider stopping the Wellbutrin before consulting the doc?"

"My new habit is watching TV standing up :). It feels like I'm reading anjg's bulletin board, but when I watch it sitting on the bed, my neck is tired :)"
"Was this sexual abuse? I’m (F25) not sure how to write this. I’ve never put down my memories to paper let alone tell anyone. A family member would do certain things between (from what little I can remember) the ages of 7-15. These things made me feel uncomfortable and I asked multiple times for it to stop to no avail. I want to protect their identity so calling them X.

1. X never let me lock the bathroom door when I shower X walks right in and has conversations with me even though the shower doors are see-through. This still happens now at 25yo. I used to lock the door when I was younger but X would use a coin to open the door and would leave it wide open so I just stoped locking the door and forget to every time now. 

2. X have always sneaked up the stairs and burst into my room on purpose. Dispute multiple times asking X to knock. If I’m just out a shower and wearing a towel I’ll always ask X to leave but X scoffs as if I should be less embarrassed and I’m weak for being embarrassed about being naked. 

3. When I was younger if I would touch myself X would take enjoyment from bursting into my room and surprising me and made me feel dirty and mentally fucked up for doing so. X would also watch through a crack in the door (caught them sometimes) before bursting in. 

4. X would ask to see my breasts and say it was to compare mine to theirs and any time I said I didn’t want to I was made to feel silly for being embarrassed like it was no big deal. 

5. X used to ask me to shower with them. Well over the age I needed anyone to wash my hair. Still asking me at 15. X would again scoff if I said no and plead for me to join them as if I was not wanting quality time with them. 

6. X flashes me (still does) and leaves the door to the bathroom wide open when they shower and sometimes calls me over to chat with them on purpose as if they want to see my reaction to seeing them naked. 

7. X would insist on checking me ‘down there’ when I was younger and would put cream on me saying there was a rash but I never saw one. I remember getting older and being adamant that I could do it myself but X got furious with me. 

8. X gets into my bed without asking when I’m in bed or when I’m not and asks me to cuddle them in their bed and gets angry when I say no. 


The next two are hard for me to type…I don’t feel ready but this platform has been really supportive so far so here goes. For content X definitely physically abused me and still emotionally abuses me and I think they are narcissistic.  


9. Growing up and even sometimes now I go into a childlike mind and put on a higher pitched child like voice (this cringes me so much so please don’t say anything nasty about this). Once when I was around 16 I was hugging X in their bed and was in this childlike state. They played into it and said ‘aww my baby, do you want to suck milk’ and I for some disgusting reason that bothers me to this day I nodded and X got their breasts out and I ….I can’t type the rest but I don’t think I need to.

10. Again difficult to put down to writing. This one I don’t know if it’s in my head. When I was younger X would ask me to sit on their lap. I would feel (or think I did) them pushing up their private part on my body. I would feel uncomfortable and would sit in a different position but it would keep happening and I learnt to ignore it. 

Sorry for the left hoy post but because this is not obvious or classic case of sexual abuse (I think) I’m just unsure if it was. I know this person would take it very badly if they knew I was thinking this and I feel like I’m betraying that persons honour or something. 

(Context : been depressed since 11/12  and after experiencing panic attacks for the first time at 25 I finally told a doctor and I’m on a waiting list to get help for pdsd (unsure if that’s what I have) and I don’t know if it’s worth mentioning this if it’s stupid or a lie or if I am even able to). I also struggle to enjoy sex unless it’s bdsm I’m not sure if that’s related but I just feel dirty if I am wanting it."
just called out of work today i m feeling like i let everyone down which i know isn t the case at least i recognize the anxiety
it was the best game ever.

"Chiropractic adjustment on neck now scared of cervical artery dissection This will sound ridiculous and it is embarassing to even type but that is what we are all here for to get these issues out in the open and find people who can support us right so here it goes. I am a 27 y.o male and have been seeing my chiro for years because I would get headaches. He uses the drop table method and I have had my neck adjusted 100s of times before. Last week I went to my doctor for an unrelated visit and mentioned I was seeing a chiropractor. He responded right away ""dont let him touch your neck"" he told me that an older patient of his had had a stroke days after a neck adjustment because of a torn artery. Now I will mention that the chiropractor this patient had seen was using a different type of manipulation on the neck as opposed to the thompson (drop table) method. At my chiropractic appointment yesterday he did what he normally does and worked kn my back and neck. this time my neck was sore all night and I have not been able to sleep or focus on work or my kids because all I can think about is ""what if he tore something, what if I am going to have a stroke????"" seems silly right? Anyone who has health anxiety knows that these ludicrous thoughts seep into our mind and pollute our rationality and thinking. I have all but convinced myself I am going to have a stroke and die and leave my kids behind fatherless no matter how crazy I know it sounds. My neck hurts as of writing this but very mild discomfort perhaps a 2 out of 10. I would assume if you tore an artery you would feel it? Anyways I would love some responses maybe just to reassure me or if anybody has some insight on an issue like this they could share.

cheers"

"I do not know if some of you remember me, but I did a post a few days back here -&gt; [Can we talk about the less obvious symptoms of depression?]( summarized now all the symptoms you have written down in the comment section. Why I do it is because for years I was beating myself up for those less obvious symptoms, because I was not aware that it goes hand in hand with depression and thought I was simply mentally and emotionally weak, compared to everybody else. Since I had this epiphany that it might be directly associated to depression, I understand my mind much better, which I find to be helpful for myself. This leads me to have more compassion for myself and knowing, that this is not necessarily who I am. It has often been pointless trying to solve those problems (which I was trying to do for years), because as long as I am/was depressed, there was literally *nothing* I could do about those less obvious symptoms. it is like working hard for having no results, and then hating myself for not making any progress at all. So I hoped to help some of the people here too.Disclaimer:This list does not serve to be self-diagnosed and many of the points do not have to have anything to do with depression.Again: these are the LESS OBVIOUS SYMPTOMS. So for example sadness, exhaustion, numbness or lack of appetite are not listed, since those would be the better-known symptoms.&amp;#x200B;COGNITIVE ABILITIES* Memory loss * Reduced focus capacity* Problems with learning * Catatonia * Less intelligent* Inability to read* Derealization / Dissociation* Negative change in executive functioning EMOTIONS + FEELINGS* Indecisiveness (even for the smallest and less important decisions) * Shame / feeling embarrassed* Guilt* Bitterness* Irritation / anger* Anxiety* Impulsiveness * Frozen (emotionally, mentally and physically)* Restless * Overwhelmed by the smallest things (emotionally, mentally and physically) SELF IMAGE* Low self-esteem * Self-loathing* Everything is my fault* Loss of identity * Fixating on physical appearance * Consistent and relentless negative self talk* Self-doubt* Imposter-syndrome PHYSICAL* Sexual impotence / asexual / very low libido* Insomnia / sleeping issues / sleep deprivation* Lack of hygiene * Losing sense of taste* Gastrointestinal symptoms * Physical aches * Physical discomfort * Headaches / Feeling like an anchor pushes on your head * Sensitive to noises * Acne, hair loss, lower back pain &amp; irregular periods (&lt;- this could be symptoms of something else, e.g. hormonal) SOCIAL* Lower social intelligence * Not being able to handle criticism * Sensitivity to rejection* Grudge holding* Decreased ability to read social ques or properly display emotions * The need for company + not having energy to be social* Wanting people to know(or notice) that you are depressed / the need for compassion* Envy of people * Not wanting to be a burden to others isolating* Hating people / misanthropy * Being rude to others OTHERS* Burnout * Overthinking* Complaining* Remember all childhood experiences and overanalyzing them * Identifying with depressed famous people and romanticizing own situation and wanting to put own negative thoughts into artwork* Never being in the moment* Not caring about the future* Exaggeration of own bad situation Comprehensive list of the less obvious symptoms of depression"
"Can Health Anxiety pop up seemingly out of nowhere? Is it normal to have a massive/crippling health-related panic attack with no history of anxiety, and have Health Anxiety related symptoms occur daily after that? It's been four months and I just want some of your guy's stories to help reassure :) "
"TW: mention of suicide, self harm, and abuse I wanted to share this story hopefully to give someone out there struggling some hope. When I was around 13 I was struggling with really bad depression. I was constantly in and out of mental hospitals and my biological father would not get me therapy and would not allow me to get medication to help. He and his girlfriend where very controlling of me and I suffered a lot of emotional abuse. It got to the point where I would self harm on the daily and if they seen it they would mock me for it. I was once left on the side of the road with no idea on how to get home and no phone. I was not allowed to eat carbs or anything high in sugar. They convinced me I was severely overweight where I was roughly 180lbs at the time. They gaslighted me and always reminded me of how great of a life I had because I had clothes and a roof over my head. To this day I have a hard time admitting that what I went through was abuse and not just strict parenting. One day I had a really bad breakdown and ended up yelling back at my stepmom. My dad came home said almost nothing to me but to get on the back of his motorcycle. I did and he took me to a little Italian restaurant. We sat in a booth on the corner and had a long talk. A younger couple, maybe in there early 20s, where seated next to us. The woman was blonde and very pretty, and who I assume was her date was a man whose face I did not see. The most rememberable part was when I said, Dad I want to kill myself, does that really mean nothing to you? He was quiet for a second as he thought about it but showed no emotion. Then he looked me in the eyes and said, I believe you think you do but you will not. This triggered something in me. It was at that moment I decided as soon as we got on that freeway on his bike I was going to jump in front of the biggest vehicle I could see. I do not remember saying much after that I just focused on finishing my eggplant parmesan. He got up to pay for the bill and as soon as he was gone the lady sat where he was and asked if she could talk to me. I hesitated then nodded. She told me that I was beautiful and intelligent and a few other things. She reminded me of the future I could have. My tears stopped as I held back a sob. My dad yelled my name and told me to get up. I remember flinching but I do not know what kept me on that seat. I could have been frozen in fear or just latching on to this strangers kind words. She said everything I needed that did not even know I needed to hear. Even if that conversation did not last longer then 2 minutes it changed my life. Now I am in a safe place with a great support system. I plan on studying to become a licensed therapist and helping kids. I wanted to share this story for anyone who is going through a tough time. It sounds cliche but I promise no matter the situation you are in right now, life will get better. A stranger saved my life"
"What's going on with me 22F.
Last year had been so weird. I graduated. Fucked a relationship up. Didn't cheat but the ex couldn't take that I slept with someone else. He was broken so I spiraled guilty anxious lonely. Also I was preparing for a big test I cared a lot. I used to be worried, cried all day. Then snap. I feel nothing. I'm sleeping all day when I go towards the books I'm like why. I'm so numb. Psychiatrist diagnosed me with atypical depression and gave me pills which I'm not allowed to take coz mom says there will be side effects. 
Today I was allowed to ride a bike. I hit a car and fell down. It was a minor accident but bro. I realized I felt nothing after that. Nothing at all. This couldn't have been me. I was a girl who was afraid to ride  bikes I used to freak out so much now I just don't care. Not even the fact that I'm able to ride the bike. If it was the earlier me I'd feel goosebumps with a sense of achievement, I'd feel fear anxious and scared about the accident. What's wrong with me I feel as though I'm an empty floating balloon."
"I, 24M am a fat stout(5'7) balding piece of shit who has a traumatic injury to the left eye and degeneration related changes in the right. Along with my childhood diagnosis of ADHD, for quite a long time, I have lost the will to live on. cannot hurt myself because it would hurt my parents but the desire to be alive and do anything worth at all keeps on lowering down further and further like drowning into a bottomless pool with light eventually fading out. The numbness is both painful and comforting at the same time.I am in a field which I love and respect and cannot complain having fared the pandemic relatively easier in comparison what horrors others have faced. Feels most the time I do not even exist. Just a substance less body floating through space goalessly. How do I regain this ever escaping will to do something, or anything with my life and actually feel something other than this mindless pain? It feels like I have lost something important a very long time ago essential for the desire to keep moving ahead and cannot seem to relocate it. The voids keeps sucking back into misery no matter how hard I try."

"Why do I even try anymore? All you all ever do is wear me out, use me, disappoint me and then leave me.Why? What sick pleasure to you all get from it? Do you enjoy watching me suffer? Do you enjoy making me suffer?These past 2-3 days I have been more miserable than in my 8 years worth of depression. Before that I was the happiest for about over a month **at least**.At this point it has to be my fault. Everything always is. I have always been the easy scapegoat, for anything. Nobody cares, I am just a carpet for everyone to walk on when they need to clean their shoes.I have been hurting for years and no one even remotely bat an eye. Everyone is fake. Fake care. Fake attention. Fake friendships. Fake family bonds. Fake work dynamics. Fake love. Fake kindness. Fake fun. All you all do is take and never care about me. I am just a tool.Once I stop being useful, once being myself overshadows the benefits I can bring you just leave me for dead.I have no one in this life. Not one soul. I will see you all in the burning abysses that I will oversee.I do not know when I am going to end it, hell, I have not thought about ending it for the past few months, but today...Just know that my previous 25yo ETA is probably further away than the current ETA.You can all go die.

And then I realized that every time I get a cold, I recheck the symptoms of the flu, pneumonia, etc. in order to rule those things out.

If I get a rash, I will look up different rashes to make sure it’s not some flesh eating bacteria. I had shingles behind my knees last year and wrote it off as dermatitis and didn’t go to see my doctor until it hurt too much to walk.

I guess I’m sort of the opposite. I try to rule out worse illnesses? But then I thought - hey, maybe that’s how you justify it, but you’re a hypochondriac silly.

Except when it comes to UTIs. I know every symptom I’ve experienced.

The past two years so much shit has happened I cannot even wrap my head around it. Mostly dealing with betrayal. I just feel so numb lately and emotionally drained like I have done spent all of it and have no emotion left. I just feel empty. Anyone else dealing with this? Emotionally dead

"Anyone who is christian and actually still believes in God this day and age, please tell him to either A. Leave me the fuck aloneB. Transport me back where I simply belong, like 40 years ago from now basically, because I truly believe he made a mistake by placing me here in this day and age orC. Fucking just send me to hell already, which is where my depressed ass probably rightfully belongs.Anyone still a Christian here? Not trying to insult anybody who is. If you are, and you truly believe in God, I am proud of you. I am glad he gave you a good life. Truly am. Unfortunately, he does not do that for everybody. Some of his human creation he simply does not give a shit about. So 9lease ask him to either kill me outright, or fucking help me . Or not. I do not really care amore at this point. Either way, I will probably be killing myself soon anyways. As is God's will. A message for all whom God loves out there"

"I have Crohn's localized entirely in the small intestine, and I am still waiting for the final procedure to confirm it so my diagnosis is official, and I can start getting treatment.I am so sick that not just my hands, but my arms shake, I am unable to work &amp; I sleep an insane amount.Last ER trip was on a Thursday; I went to sleep that night, and aside from getting up to pee, I slept until Sunday morning at 1 am.I only have one family member who can help me out, because I am jobless, carless and so sick, and it is draining the hell out of them.This disease has been going on for years, and I also caught H Pylori, which sped up my health descent to the point where it was obvious to everyone else that something was wrong.I would lost numerous jobs in recent years because I would either be too sick to go in or I would get sick at work and have to leave.This lead my family and my (now ex) girlfriend to think I just did not like working or was lazy.The toll all of this has had on me mentally, plus some other things which would take too long to get into, is pretty devastating.My social life has also disappeared, and being 37, it is not likely to get better anytime soon.I am getting proper treatment and there is no interest in self harm, but I am extremely burned out, and there is not much to look forward to, because the pain I am constantly in is so debilitating, surgery is a realistic expectation, and would push me back even further.The only hobbies I have ever had are all physical, and I do not have any energy for exercise Shit is bad right now"
"miss is simple. I, you, meet."
since i wa diagnosed with depression my mother pretty much didn t care about the case that i have it every time i try to approach to her and like to talk about my problem she just groan annoyed about it and tell me to be more positive no deep conversation no sight of empathie only typical standard bullshit phrase every person would say who never had it and can t understand it i went through some ruff shit and after everything that happend i just get those bland annoyed response from the person who gave birth to me

"I fucking hate the way I feel about her and everything I fucking hate all of this shit, I literally couldn’t give a shit if she breaks up with me. Is it so fucking hard too atleast spare some time to your boyfriend for a hug??? Maybe just going out once in a while?? What’s the point of you wanting to be with me if you’re gonna just keep pushing our plans back over and over. Am I that fucking embarrassing to be around? Am I ugly? I workout to maintain a physique In hopes you find me even more attractive but I feel uglier than ever now. JUST END THINGS WITH ME ALREADY I literally don’t care anymore but I can’t just break up with you because I fucking love you and I hate being alone so much. You call me your love, you call me your man but I just feel like that one fucking friend that no one wants to make plans with. You say I make you the happiest you’ve ever been but we haven’t even been on a date yet. You say you’ve never felt the way you do about anyone else but you can’t even spare 5 minutes after school to atleast hug me? I want to love you so much and I want to give you all the attention you deserve. I want to keep looking into your eyes and having those weird feelings whenever we have nothing to say. You know how much I fucking love you and how much you mean to me. but its cutting into my fucking heart that you would rather keep this relationship more through text than have something more connecting like in person. you reading this, am I fucking selfish for wanting to be loved for atleast 5 minutes? Am i selfish to want to keep a connection with someone who everyday tells me how much they love me? I fucking hate this shit so much."

"I wouldn't say I'm a generally anxious person, but I have severe anxiety when it comes to my living space. I've lived alone in various apartments for a few years now, and I don't ever let people come over. I'm pretty messy, but not anything extreme enough to justify keeping people away. My boyfriend has only been over a handful of times and I do my best to rush him out. I'll go out of my way to keep people out."
"Crippling fear Hey guys, I’m posting this because I want to see if I’m the only one. My grandma passed on her hypochondria to me, and ever since I suffered a spinal injury my sophomore year of highschool I’ve been terrified of doctors visits and every little pain, ache, tingle, and spasm I get in my body. I went to a sports specialist for my back and he diagnosed me with a C5 fracture, and scoliosis. I can live with that. But after I became aware that my body is injured and no longer the same, I’ve been obsessed with the idea that I have cancer, a brain tumor, or MS. Usually it’s cancer that takes over my thoughts.

My thing is, I avoid the doctors office in every way possible. I HATE the idea of going to the doctor, being diagnosed, because to me my life is over at that point. I can usually talk myself through my panic episodes, but I usually seek the reassurance of others. I have a mole on my back and I’m convinced it’s changing, so every other week I ask my girlfriend if it’s changed and she says of course not. I can’t remember what it looked like as a kid, but I could’ve sworn it didn’t look like it does now. My anxiety is so bad I went to the doctor when I had a flu that wouldn’t go away, got chest x-rays to rule out pneumonia, and before my doctor told me the results I told him, “look, if I have cancer I don’t want to know, just don’t tell me” and he looked at me like I was crazy because the X-ray came back perfectly fine, just a common flu.

I’ve avoided the doctors office for so long now that I feel like there HAS to be something wrong. Terminal. I know I should go, but even thinking about the idea makes me shutter with fear. A lot of the posts I read on here are about people that go to the doctor too much, but I wanted to see if there were people out there that are like me."
guten morgen up and off to get ready to go to phantasialand cologne yay but booooo last park of holiday
My friend told me that she has depression and I want to be supportive but I cannot see how I can be. she lives far away so I cannot visit her. she has adhd if that is relevant. I just really want to help and be supportive but I do not know how. How can I help?
I have been struggling with depression and questioning who I am as a person for the last couple of years but it recently has been getting way worse. I wrote a song to express myself if anyone wanted to hear it. I know I am not supposed to do it
Happy birthday big guy keep up the good work @Brandon_Leach7
"On Therapy My therapist is very talented.  In fact, she was booked for the entire month of December and for all but the last week of this month.  That means it'll be almost two months between appointments, when I'm used to seeing her twice a month.  This has never happened in our quite lengthy time together, and I'm scheduled through March from here on out.

Therapy is an interesting thing for me.  Because I come from a very traumatic background, therapy has been a godsend for PTSD-related issues.  What I'd never noticed before, though, is how much it helps me regulate my mood in between sessions.  Knowing I'll have someone to help me sort through random thoughts and make sense of any major shifts or psychotic issues allows me to keep the jumble in the background.  It's like static; I can tolerate the static when I know there will eventually be someone who can help me understand how the radio works. (bad example but best I can do.)

My therapist, pdoc, and I constantly assess whether therapy is beneficial to me, because it has been ongoing for quite some time.  We were all of the understanding that, yes, in fact, I get a great deal of benefit from therapy.  Now I'm one month into not having therapy, and things are falling absolutely apart.  Suspicion confirmed.

I will go on through this month doing the best I can, and I will try not to break any more aspects of life.  Then, I will spend a couple of sessions picking up the pieces and hoping this sort of break in our therapy journey does not happen again anytime soon."
I need help being grateful and content again. I have been depressed most of my life but I am at a breaking point. I am worried my child will be mentally disabled or mentally ill and its all my fault. I wish he had a better chance in life. I prayed for a baby and now I say why did god let this happen if the baby will only suffer?I feel like I am living in hell. This might be the most mentally disturbed I have ever been. I have never suffered like this.Please tell me there is a reason to go on. Pregnant and suicidal
"I have been in this sink of depression for months. I cannot get up most mornings, I lay in bed, I play PC games to escape, and I just throw myself a pity party all of the time playing the victim when its all my fault. A few months ago I broke up with my gf of 5 years for a lot of reasons. She was more career oriented, she chose it over me. I cannot be mad at someone for following their dreams but I was so hurt she chose to go to an out of state school, especially since already just up and left to work far away without talking with me about it. She then contacts me saying she is actually not going to an out of state school, but the school we talked about in the first place. But I cannot stand talking to her, she makes me so angry I fall into this rage filled depression. I am supposed to start school as a fire fighter at my local college. I feel fat, depressed, and disgusting. I have waited for this opportunity for so long, I cannot get up to find motivation or anything. I do not know what to do or how to handle this. I feel horrible"

"Trouble Swallowing Sup y’all I’m 30 y/o and not sure what’s going on with me. I’ve had severe anxiety for the past 2 years, my body is constantly sending weird symptoms which throw me into complete panic. 

My latest worry is chest pain. Feels like food is getting stuck in my chest, like it’s not going all the way into my stomach and it’ll cause my chest to hurt for hours until I have to eat again. I don’t have any choking but I can literally feel the food traveling down my chest. Anyone else ever experience this? "
I do not understand how I have trouble with my depression when things have been going well for me. I started a great job and got into grad school but feel useless and hopeless. My family keeps asking me whatbis wrong and gets annoyed when I tell them honestly that I have no idea. I just want to shut out the world and be alone in that familar silence. I hate myself for feeling this way.
"Fake clarity So interesting how clear everything seems to be while manic. I know the answers to problems that have been plaguing me. I feel like everything falls into place. I am finally cured of all my anxieties and feel silly for worrying about them in the first place. I spent money on hobbies I've given up on because I know I'll suddenly get good at it *this* time. Oh and no I don't need to see my therapist again or take my meds because I'm *cured* finally!

But of course this lasts for maybe a week until I hit reality hard and everything takes over. But it won't happen *this* time. No of course not.

Fml."
"all the sudden all the hate turned against me again (happened often before). She yelled out, whining for her dad, who she called. i stayed calm but was totally clueless about what to do. she started breaking up with me, telling me that she will spent the night at a hotel or somewhere on the street. i shouldnt come visit her at the hospital next week ... blackmailing me basically."
"all it takes is will power, and you have it."
"The life I've worked for is gone. When I was 18, I had moved out because I has a strained relationship with my family. I moved away because I wanted to put distance so that the relationship could be repaired. I ended up moving across state lines and then eventually moved down south, halfway across the country, at my father's suggestion for an easier life while I worked and got my degree. And the distance did exactly what I wanted: it showed my parents that I was strong and capable and mature and that I was an adult. But it also created a great longing for home. 

Life was easier. I got a better job, I bought a house, and I live comfortably with my husband. But... We don't like it here. We like the small city, the restaurants, the proximity, the healthcare, etc. But the environment and climate do not align with us. We are northerners at heart. We like the seasons, fall and winter, the hills, the mountains, the streams winding through the forest. We miss it so dearly it hurts sometimes. 

But I also miss my family. I miss my parents, my brother, my nephew. I miss my childhood best friend and her family. I am heartbroken seeing years pass and I am missing from their daily life and they are missing from mine. I am just incredibly lonely here, and I want to be with them. 

There has always been an obstacle preventing us from moving back, but the biggest one being how expensive it is there, and we would have struggled unless we were finished school and in our well-playing fields. So years pass by and we stay here, while wishing we there. 

Well now my parents are getting older, approaching their 60s. They want to retire, but they don't want to retire there, they want to retire in the state I'm currently in. 

So then, becomes a new dilemma: do I stay in this state that doesn't make me happy, so I can be with my parents (and potentially my brother in time)? Do I move back home and enjoy my brother's company for as long as I have it, I have my friends, my climate, and my job? Either way I'm giving up something that feels non-negotiable for my complete happiness. 

I'm overcome with this intense sadness that I've spent all the years where I could have had it all being away. And now they are gone and I feel as if the life I have worked so hard in my degree and in life to get back to is gone. 

Ive tried talking to my family about staying in their current state or maybe moving to another state that I know they love and enjoy and that we do as well, and they don't budge - this is their plan. I feel selfish when I push too hard. 

I don't know what to do. I'm overwhelmed with sadness. I just accepted a job in my career because I just graduated but its even further south and even though its an amazing career opportunity, I feel like its a step backward in the life I wanted."
Moving to Central Jakarta around Menteng today.. anyone want to fill the slot??
"Hi- I am wondering something. Recently my bf of over 1 1/2 years broke up with me telling me that he just feels different right now but not about us or about the relationship. It is about him. This was completely out of the blue, as in the day before I am the love of his life, etc all of that. He says he still feels all of that and never fell out of love. But that he has some issues or problems he is trying to solve and he is having a hard time doing that so he is having a hard time doing the romantic part right now and getting rid if the problem . But being friends with him during this is helping more than I can imagine . He said he tried for a few weeks to do both and he cannot, and the problem affects everything in his life. He. has no idea how to solve, or how it is going to go, or how long it is going to takeHe will not tell me what the 'issue' is, but said it is something I cannot fix. He has told nobody else. For a few different reasons, I feel that there is an emotional and mental issue behind this. Maybe he never told meCan you tell me if it is normal to hide depression type of things from those you love? He has said it would not be good for our relationship or fair to me (if he did this bf/gf thing) during this crisis. Can any of you explain why?Can anyone explain the logic of sticking me in a friend box during this? I do not understand this at all. We talk alot (though the content is more basic I notice) and though we see each other less, we are affectionate like hugging. What is the point of removing the relationhip piece.I do not know whether slowing my contact down with him will help him or make him think I do not care. I really do . I do not plan to go anywhere, but am I doing the right thing? I am taking care of myself; I am not that great at all but getting through day to day. I did not unload on him how upset I really am. Last I keep reading how depression changes people. I am worried he will come out of whatever is going on and just not want the relationship again. Thanks for the information. Depressed and ending relationship- looking for some answers and experiences"
Having weird thoughts I'd share (don't worry not suicidal) Do you ever have that weird feeling where you just have that fear of getting to attached to someone or something? Like you get this thrill like yes finally something good happened but then in the back of your mind your just scared of something bad happening before you know you'll screw it up or something bad will always repeat? I found out I'm moving again and I've lost track how many times I've moved and I recently got this job a few months ago and I am in love with it and I'm scared that I don't find anything similar to it when I move and another thing I'm just scared to lose the people I'm close too all over again. It seems like it's always like that the people I love the most go the farthest away. I've lost a of people in my life and opportunities and I'm scared this is another one of those things. I wish I had a place called home where I can settle and do what I love with the people I love. Sorry for the vent I just needed to let it out I guess.

"i hate the panic and loss of control i feel over myself when i starting realizing how alone i am. the sitting against the floor just wishing things could have been the slightest different. my mom kicked me out 4 months ago and i live my my dad on his couch right now. i moved to a different state during covid last year and hardly can talk to any of my old friends, my mom cut off my therapist so i cannot call her anymore and I am so tired of talking to my family about it because they just never understand the full extent of what my mom put me through and how bad my depression and anxiety is. they all want me to text her her and i have a panic attack anytime i even think about communicating with her. she sent my brother birthday gifts for me and I have been sitting on the bathroom floor for twenty minutes sobbing because I am so tired of her trying to be in my life still and i wish she would just please leave me alone. i hate when the wave comes back"

I don’t know what to do I just want to stop hurting Everyone always leaves in my life wether it’s friends or girlfriends and I understand why. I try to be the most kind person I can be and everyone treats me like shit. I then try to stand up for myself and now have nobody. And now everyday I’m in constant conflict with myself trying to figure out if I’m just pushing them away. But i can even ask anyone because I have no friends. I don’t know if it’s because I’m ugly because a lot of girls i meet we have a sexual or romantic encounters but they always make things just friends. I started to think maybe I deserve being alone for like a past life or something idk. I’m just looking for friends i guess and this is a desperate attempt sorry for taking up your time if this is too much. Have a good one

"My hair was cut accidentally way too short and ended up as a Karen cut, I was already anxious but now I can’t leave my house. I need advice I went for a haircut yesterday because my anxiety has been awful. I had a CT scan this week, my OCD returned in full force, my house is a disaster, etc. I just wanted to feel pretty. I went for just a trim and to color my roots so I would have my normal chin length bob that I curl. It’s the best cut I’ve ever had, however, my stylist (and I don’t blame him at all) misunderstood me because I communicated poorly and chopped off all of my hair, and stacked it so I have nothing but layers. To make it worse I’m prematurely gray, I thought it would be nice to blend in my natural gray streak with some color to highlight it but make it look a little more intentional. I now look like I’m a mix between Cruela De Vil and a 60 year old that screams at Target employees. I’m devastated. I’m mourning my hair and embarrassed to leave my home. I don’t even want to go for therapy today. I couldn’t sleep. I know it grows back but to get to the point I want it will take over 6 months. I didn’t want a pixie and my jaw looks cartoonish. I’m not usually concerned how I look but I spent so much time trying to style it to fix it. I tried curling it to no avail. I tried to wet it down and with my natural hair I ended up a poodle. I just want to cry, I want my stomach to stop hurting, I want to sleep and not worry. What can I do?"

"terrified of the flu! 2018 flu deaths have me panicking All of the news lately shows someone new dying from the flu this  year... I didn't get a flu shot. I'm in the Midwest, and the only deaths reported thus far have been the elderly around here but in California and other places people my age (mid-twenties) are dying left and right!

how concerning is this? are these fluke accidents or do I need to be worried? what can I do to prevent the flu??? :("
Sick of it all. No clue what to do seems like the only option. Shit does not get better matter of fact it only gets worse fuck this Never thought about suicide this much in my life
"so i was in therapy for depression and one session, my therapist said she wanted to talk more about my childhood trauma (which she made me feel like it was some fascinating story to her rather than, you know, trauma) and when i said i just was not really in the mood or comfortable enough to talk about it all yet, she said it was okay and moved on. i had only seen her for around four months at that point, once a week if that, so i just was not ready to dive into it all. anyway, our very next session, she told me that i had improved immensely since we first started and not only did she think that i was completely free of any depression symptoms, she said that she was going to be canceling further appointments and that if i needed a visit really bad, just to text her and she could set up a quick meeting. but since then, i have never felt worse. i know what depression looks like and now i feel super invalid for even thinking i have it because i was already tipping a little towards the worst when she dropped me. my father committed suicide when i was younger and so whenever i bring up the fact that my depression seems like it is getting worse, my mom changes the subject immediately and most often will not make a single comment on what i said. i got into my dream school for this fall as a sophmore and i have never felt less enthusiastic about anything - i told my therapist that i was unsure of my major and she told me that it did not really matter because in the end, it is just a degree. i tried to talk about what my future career might look like and she told me that, once again, it does not matter right now and that i should not even be worried about it. half a year ago, looking forward to my future was one of the few things that i was able to be positive about but now? i feel stupid for thinking i even have one. i honestly do not even know what to do and i feel like i need to attend therapy again but clearly my therapist thinks I am faking and not many accept my insurance. my family clearly does not even want to speak about it and i have absolutely no friends because i moved to my current city only six months ago and i know no one. i also do not even know if I am considered suicidal because thinking about it does make me cry and make me sad but at the same time, thinking about simply not existing anymore is also one of the happiest things that i could experience right now. i just do not know if i should even try to save myself i was not comfortable talking about my trauma yet so my therapist dropped me - I have now had the worst three weeks of my life"
"Hi,I feel very confused and lost at the time I am typing this. I have moments where I feel like I am coping with life and then there are times when I just want to stop. I feel extremely overwhelmed and I do not know what to do to distract myself and be productive. I am a 43-year-old male, in a committed relationship where me being a responsible, income-earning contributor is essential and there are a lot of times where I feel very close to just quitting my job and isolating myself. I am on medicine for many different conditions and I take them consistently. I am trying so hard but it feels like my body and my mind are determined to do the opposite of what it needs to do for me to stay afloat.I am sure there are a lot of people going through this, I know it is not just me and I am not complaining to get pity.

"Does anyone here have FMLA for depression? Is that a thing? Over time, I have discovered that working full-time really triggers my depression. I feel like it makes life pointless. Like what is the purpose of working 40+ hours a week just to pay your mortgage/bills? Then you have no time for yourself. But without the full-time job, you have no health insurance, and not enough money to do anything in your spare time. Makes absolutely no sense to me. When everything was shut down during coronavirus, I felt so much better. I was even able to get off meds I had time to cook and eat well, to get proper sleep, and just to focus on and take care of myself. Then I went back to work 3 days a week for about the past year and everything was still fairly good. I was managing that ok. But, I recently had to go back to working 40 hours, and the downward spiral has already begun. Its only been a couple weeks, and I already feel like shit. I do not even want to get out of bed anymore :( Working makes me depressed"

"How I am *almost* over my Health Anxiety Quick intro:
3 years a go I had an incident in the shower that mimicked a stroke. I came out of it unharmed but it messed me up psychologically. Ever since then my body takes any feeling it gets and goes into panic mode. Now i hate driving, i hate taking a shower, i hate exercising. You name it, if i makes me hot, i get anxious. At onc point i was so anxious showering i had to sit down and hold on for dear life the entire time i was in there.

Now i'm about 80% over it. and form my experience the only way over it - is to go through it. And what i mean by that is you need to face this demon head on. I know its the last thing you want to hear but trust me. If you never face it you will be running forever.

However it will take time for your brain to rewrite its default path ways. So at the moment the default behavior is fear, and to curl up and say please dont hurt me. So your brain interprets it as a threat and will spiral out of control causing all sorts of symptoms the worst of which being a panic attack.

Now next time you start getting the fear coming on try this instead. Say to your fear out loud ""Just kill me then"" ""Bring it on"" ""Lets see what you can do"" and taunt your fear and let what ever you think is going to happen happen. by wanting the what ever it is you are afraid of to happen will make the fear vanish.

Another thing to think. If you were to say have a heart attack it would just happen... whether you worried or not. Worrying isnt going to some how miraculously save you.

At my lowest - the turning point for me was when i just thought i'd rather be dead than to feel like this anymore. and from then on i basically laid down my life to my fear and said just kill me. Kill me now or shut the fuck up. I needed to hit rock bottom so I could rebuild my brain the right way. and for a few weeks i just kept saying ""Kill me now or shut up"" over and over until my brain started using the new default behavior. 

It can take months to retrain your brain and then add years on that to fully forget. but this is what is working for me.

TLDR: Taunt your fear. egg it on. call it out. ask it to do its worst even if it kills you. Let it flow through you and out the other side I bet nothing bad happens

TLDR 2: If you were going to die it would just happen... whether you worried or not. Worry isnt going to some how miraculously save you"
"Season Change Mood Flux Hello, I'm Bipolar 1 with SAD as well. Is anyone else currently experiencing bouts of Stability, Anxiety, Depression and Confidence.

"She taught me a bunch at first. In the beginning of the week people asked what me and my Ex did. I informed them we broke up and it was due to infidelity on her part. This was not a cool move, however, I knew her sister would try to paint me as the bad guy. I was spot on."

"i refuse to acknowledge when i need help and when i do need help the idea of asking for it is mortifying. case in point, I am currently at my dads for a month and i just started my period but instead of asking my dad to get pads I am just sucking it up and using toilet paper ... tmi i know but all the same its annoying. I am not embarrassed per se that i need pads i just hate relying on people for things I am too damn independent"

"I have never really felt like I belonged or that anyone really cared about me. My family is very bad at showing affection, praise or even attention. As a child, my parents were too busy working and raising my younger siblings to give me the attention I needed. Fast forward and all my high school friends abandoned me for their significant others. I was the only one who was not in a relationship. there is a reason I do not talk to them anymore. When I turned 21, I met my future wife. We dated for 5 years before I proposed. We married and after 3 years, she wanted out. She lost her attraction to me was her reasoning. She left me in our home and she took our child with her. The only living creature that ever gave me unconditional love was my dog. She was really my only friend the year after my child was born. My wife withheld affection and intimacy from me when I asked for it. I had to put my dog to sleep because she had an inoperable tumor on her heart. After that, I had no one and its where I am today. I am fearful that when I start dating again, I am going be afraid of rejection or possible abandonment. Trust is very hard to come by for me and I am socially anxious to begin with. I just feel so worthless and beat down by life. I guess even when everyone around you knows how severe your depression is, they do not care enough to try and help. Feeing abandoned by everyone"
It's been wrong from the start today's meeting
Therapist: what are you crying about? Me: I have no fucking idea. It really do be like that

"Hey, I have been suffering with depression since my early teens and I have just hit a slump with every aspect of my life. I feel awful all the time, I have lost interest in all of my passions and my motivation is short lived. I am constantly surrounded by people who ask for my support but never actually show that they care, I have hardly any friends and the ones that do do not seem to care. Normally, I would be the supportive friend , but at this point i really cannot be arsed with any of it nor do i care about their problems anymore.it is getting harder and harder to put up with people's shit, I am angry at everyone around me but I am even angrier at myself. I feel useless, sleeping for 12 hours though i could get up after 8 because there is nothing in the day for me to care about except sleeping. I am becoming more and more angry at everything"
one of my biggest fear is trying everything possible to turn my life around from grade to career career to myself then still come out being the same or still having the same hallow feeling i wan na take this next year to change my life around for the best i wan na look back and be happy with my life and what i ve accomplished i ve learned throughout the year that i really do want to be alive i just don t want to be me i wish i could change myself and who i am and where i came from but i can t so i would like to better myself do something to make myself proud i just don t want to waste even more time trying to fix myself then still be unhappy this fear probably came from my dad he s a ex heroin addict yet in his 0 he went from a crackhead to owning his own auto repair shop ha a beautiful yr old and amazing wife yet he still the most cold hearted asshole he still cant get more then a couple hr of sleep he s drunk every night he rarely speaks a word to me so from heroin addict to a shop owner yet still unhappy still suicidal still fighting after doing so fucking much is that really all there is to life constantly fighting to be happy without ever truly feeling it you may hide it or distract for awhile but it always come back and harder everytime till one day
I feel like such a burden on everyone in my life even when I talk to my friends they always seem like they do not want to be there and would rather be doing something else I feel like such a burden
"Can anxiety get triggered by nothing? I don’t know how to explain it but the last week or two I have been in a constant panic mode. always on edge , I feel sick 24/7, crying etc. But nothing has triggered me ? I just woke up one day and I knew something wasn’t right in my brain , I just felt really fuzzy and confused and now two weeks later I’m in a constant fight or flight mode."

"The only thing i keep myself alive for is self pityful hope in therapy. I am extremely irresponsible, often skip meds and do not bring test results on time. Obviously, they are not working. My therapist and I do not have chemistry and I ever only had a slither of hope when she was confident in my first diagnosis during my first session. I have seen her numerous times and tried various medication but nothing seems to work, even when I take it responsibly but I guess i do not endure enough long. I am sabotaging my own promise. Most recently I was on olanzapine, aripiprazole and eftil. She proposed to try lithium salts but, obviously, i skipped the necessary tests because of how much of a failure I am.I have nothing else to try for. I will talk to her one last time and if nothing promising happens, that is it. I promised before ending it all to give one last pityful attempt to therapy, and its not working."
"So I have been building up depressed feelings over the past year. By now I am at the point where I just do not see the point in life on this earth anymore. I do not like myself, my social life is a flop, I have too much anxiety to study and I do not feel like I have a future (apart from how fucked up this world is in general). I sometimes to about this with my partner and I express not wanting to wake up or just die and I will ask the question ""Why would I keep going?"". His answer then is ""Well because existing is better than not existing"". But I am wondering... Is that even true? Is it really better to exist for a full life, where at the end of the balance you felt like shit 80-90% of the time? is not it then better to not exist at all?I was wondering what you guys think about this from a philosophical point of view? Is existing better than not existing?"
"Hello people,I hope everyone who is struggling right now can hold on, even if it means taking it 5 minutes at a time. I will try to keep this short and sweet (bittersweet? is that more appropriate in this context?). I just turned 40 in February. Everyone who I have discussed age with assures me ""age is just a number"". But this year feels a little different. I am not suicidal, or in danger of hurting myself or anyone else. I have struggled with depression and some anxiety since I was 18 or so. At times (mainly in my 20's) I was hospitalized, afraid to live, but just as afraid to die. I did recover somewhat, and was able to hold down a job for a few years.These days, I just feel this feeling growing that things will only get harder- that I am 40, and that any chance to make something of myself is behind me. Thank you for reading this. If anyone would like to chime in and share how they feel, I would appreciate it. In Limbo"

"Do we notice things more than others? Why do the smallest things affect us so much. So, let me use an example bc I do not know what to do with myself right now, I've been having a very bad depressive episode this week and today I needed the help of someone very close to me who also happens to be my coworker. I messed up, life has been extra overwhelming lately and it's hard to work, I can't focus and even the smallest of things drain me even if those around me don't see it, it's so hard to do daily tasks im so tired of it all. 
I messed up, and there was an order I did not place by mistake, I forgot about it, and I even forgot what I had spoken to this particular client about. I was sure he remembered who I was, and i was terrified of looking like a dumbass and him asking for a supervisor bc this is the kind of person he is. So I asked my friend to help me, I was frantic, and I am one to always help anyway I can when there's a mistake on their part or anything goes down, no matter how busy I am with my own things. They did not seem thrilled that I asked for help and  didn't even get a confirmation on whether or not they'd help. Perhaps I'm making this bigger than it is, but it was hurtful to see how unwilling they were to help me while I was panicking. I rarely ask anything of anybody bc I have learned to be self-sufficient, and bc with bipolar I have 0 friends. I'm just sad that I didn't get a smidgen of consideration and just went for it on my own. Issue is being resolved now, and after 20 minutes, my coworker has approached me to say, ""So what do I have to do?"" Meaning when I explained everything earlier, including the solution, they were not even paying attention. I told them I got it now, and they walked away annoyed. 
Is this me just raging for no reason? Did I just make this bigger than it really is? Or why would their reaction affect me so bad. Thank you for reading and sharing your view."

"The connection was 100% real and 100% mutual, no way around it and it’s the first time I’ve felt that way about someone in 8 years. Being around her lit a fire in me again - I wanted to be a better man because of her. I was sweet to her but not overly so, her son was with his dad for Christmas and I sent her flowers since I knew she was feeling down. She called me the next day and was so grateful and loved them. I was complementary of her and she ate it up and asked me in a non-guilty (more of an “I love how you are to me” way) why I’m so sweet to her."
"Recovery feels familiar, so it's less scary, but I'm also so much more tired of it all. I want to move on. I had been able to move on! I got so much stronger! And now I'm back here, a delicate PTSD flower."

"But it takes me up to 3 hours sometimes to get out of bed. I do not know why. On days that I work, I get up at the last possible second. How can I make this easier? I feel like such trash wasting so long in bed. I used to think me struggling to get out of bed was because I did not sleep enough"

i m 0 and i m alone and it s tough to pretend i m a whole person amp x 00b i haven t made a friend since high school i m starting to befriend someone at work but it s giving me a lot of anxiety because when am i going to say the thing that make her hate me it feel like i have to do everything right to be social or maybe i m missing something that everyone else ha or maybe i m just not cut out to be social but to have friend you have to answer them when they fucking text regardless of what s going on in my life and i just don t have the energy to keep up with that i recently had someone tell me i wa probably not doing well on bumble bff because i m a slow responder sometimes i don t know what to say sometimes word aren t happening in my brain sometimes i m just too tired maybe missing out on social thing for all of my 0 s is something i m never going to be able to recover from amp x 00b i ve been in a lot of workplace where i wa the loser i had no friend i d catch people saying mean thing about me they all get together with each other and i m not invited i ve been in multiple situation where group of people don t like me and do shitty passive aggressive thing to me every chance they get i don t know what i do wrong i try to just be a genuine kind person i get feedback that i m nice i know i m not perfect but at least i ve had some feedback that i m not totally delusional to think i m a nice person but there have also been a few time where i know what i said there have been a few time when i can pinpoint the off comment that make someone turn on me and it must be more than one off comment because it s always easy for that person to get a group to turn on me it s terrifying to feel like at any moment i can slip up and someone will just decide i m not worth their time amp x 00b and i never feel like i say the right thing some of my coworker s response are lackluster think lol and i just wonder if she even want to talk to me making friend give me the same anxiety that trying to date someone give me that s kind of fucked up i should probably not care so much whether or not someone decides they want to be my friend but also it affect me i feel like i m not worthy of friendship because so many people have decided i m not worth their time and honestly this is a big moment for me because this is the moment i realize i ve internalized all that rejection and got to where i don t feel good enough for friendship why would someone pick me when i m a ball of nerve why would someone want to hang out with someone who only feel like half a person amp x 00b lately i ve been doing okay relative to the last 0 year i finally got a job that doesn t feel like chinese water torture i m on medication and that help a ton i m a lot better about not letting myself slip into negative thought pattern this week i haven t been feeling the overwhelming cloud of misery because i finally got medication that isn t expired and i m taking it regularly but every time i think about social stuff it just give me this squished feeling i can t name the feeling but it s visceral my body feel shitty i m going on a vacation with my mom and her work friend in a month and i m so fucking nervous because what if i do the thing that make everyone hate me i don t even know what the fucking thing is but spending four day with people who are talking crap about you in a small space i did that around this time last year and it wa so bad amp x 00b okay amp x 00b i m a solution oriented person and part of my problem is that i don t know how to fix this part of my life i don t really know what the solution is to feeling unworthy of friendship it took me eight year to figure out the solution to hating myself and honestly even though it s a struggle it s also worth it to fight through those feeling and find an even timbre social situation are just approached totally differently from a mental health perspective i ve googled how to feel le lonely and the fucking answer wa make friend how do you make friend when you feel like nobody want to be your friend and for good reason therapist have basically told me to find a group and the friendship will happen naturally but there s not a huge meet up scene in my area and i have a ton of anxiety about going to one and the few i have been to were not great i couldn t read the book on how to influence people and never feel powerless again i got halfway through it and it honestly felt like customer service kiss as bullshit but this time i m not even getting paid for it that book make me feel like i have to scrub my personality clean and poke myself into a small box to be socially acceptable amp x 00b i just don t know i m going to keep trying different thing i m going to keep putting myself out there because the only other choice is to keep doing thing the same shitty way with the same shitty outcome amp x 00b i needed this rant today and if anyone actually manages to read all that thanks for your time and i hope both our day get better

I was always diagnosed with anxiety and depression but I thought that I had depersonalization along with it and it was just not an issue to the psychiatrist.

I guess my questions are, what is bipolar disorder? Does this include depersonalization? Does this mean that emotions are all over the place and sporadic?

I am currently on Lamotrigine and Zoloft, any good experiences with that? Hoping it takes affect soon since I've been really manic and depressed at the same time."

"Ever since I got off my meds... I started developing fears, first I got really claustrophobic to the point where my dad exchanged an RV we bought because I couldn't sleep in the bunk beds due to panic attacks (there were also other reasons for the exchange, main ones being the need for more space and storage), and now, I've developed a fear of the dark.

I got used to just leaving the light on in the hallway if I got too scared, but today, I went to bed without the light, and looked out of my door (I'm used to sleeping with it open), and saw these stick figures and I'm telling you it scared the shit out of me, I literally felt my heart drop (thankfully, it stoped after a few seconds of terror, turning on my phones flashlight pretty much saved me). Now that I'm thinking about it, it might be due to the fact that I haven't slept in 36 hours. But ultimately, I feel like living is hard enough without me being constantly in fear of things that I know aren't real but my stupid brain still won't let go of.

Also, my doctors know I'm not taking my meds anymore, it was my doctors plan to get me off them slowly, I just kinda skipped the whole getting off your meds slowly part and went cold turkey.

I guess I just needed to vent."

"Tired of ""Surviving"" Episodes, Feeling Demoralized Hi BipolarReddit,

I'm having a rough time lately and I was hoping you could offer me some advice. I was diagnosed with BPD about four months ago, and have had developing symptoms for about a year. I have a therapist, my toolbox of coping skills is extensive but that's all I'm doing: coping. I have recently decided to pursue getting medicated and getting my moods stabilized. The medicine has not started to affect me yet (which I understand is normal) and I'm getting very demoralized. I'm tired of ""surviving"" with BPD. I want to thrive, and feel happy. I don't want to be constantly worried and unsure of my decision making skills because I'm manic or depressive. I know that eventually I will find a medication that works for me, and I will be able to cope better and thrive. I'm just feeling extremely demoralized and defeated lately. I need to find ways to imporve my morale and will to keep fighting through this. Please help me.

Sincerely,

NewandImproving"

"I feel like I'm in a room between rooms I'm going to start dissociating soon. I can tell when it's about to happen.

I feel like I only exist for other people's benefit. I'm just a paycheck for my partner. I'm just someone who takes the kids out on the weekend or helps put them to bed at night. I'm just there to help and then when I'm done helping I need to shut the fuck up and go away and stop being needy and annoying.

Nobody has time for me. Nobody gives a damn what I want. But everyone needs me to exist.

Is it worth living when you have nothing to live for and nothing to look forward to?

I'm just existing for the sake of existing. I'd rather not exist anymore. My feelings are not severely painful by any measure, but they are constant and gnawing. It's this constant low level pain that is grind me down. It's hard to describe. It's boredom and loneliness and resentment mixed in with regret at all the choices I've made that lead me to this point in my life."

"One thing I find hard Thinking about when I was hypomanic, one of the hardest things is that looking back on it, a lot of the stuff I said and did was really funny. I leaned into that a lot at the time and even resorted to full-on clowning and cringe humour cos it’s always been a defence mechanism for me. But underneath I was feeling desperate and really scared because I couldn’t stop talking and didn’t know what was happening to me. I knew I wasn’t in control and I thought if I could only make the people around me laugh it would all be ok.

Now it’s over, I’ve even turned it into a kind of comedy routine but every time I go through it, I enjoy the funniness but also can’t stop thinking, “God, I was in so much pain.” Can anyone relate?"
"In need of some advice/support Hey all! First I want to say thank you to everyone in this sub. I’ve been quietly reading your posts for months now and it is truly the reason I don’t feel so alone anymore. 
I’ve been dealing with health anxiety since I was 12. I saw a poster in the nurse’s office at school which explained the symptoms of menengitis and spent almost a year touching my chin to my neck to make sure I was okay.  Then, it turned into having anxiety about HIV/AIDS and lymphoma. My anxiety was so bad I had to drop out of my dream college because I couldn’t handle it. 
I felt happy for years after that. I focused on other things. But this January something changed. I suddenly began feeling everything I used to before. Constantly worried about various diseases even after being reassured that I was okay. 
It’s straining my relationships with my family, my boyfriend, and my friends. My constant reassurance seeking is making everyone lose their patience with me. I feel like I can’t handle it anymore. I sleep most of the day because that’s the only time when the terrible thoughts don’t come. 
The worst part is this feeling I like to call “happy...but”. It occurs in situations where I feel happy but cannot truly experience the moment for what it is because I’m worried. “I’m happy...but I could have a disease” “I’m happy... but it will only be for a little while until the anxiety comes back.” 

Anyone else feel this way? "

"Its almost 6 in the morning and I did not sleep at all once again. I am laying in bed and I just feel so so fucking empty and i cannot stop crying. I want to relapse but I am so unmotivated that I cannot even do that..you know its bad when you do not even have enough motivation to self harm. I just want to feel ok. Its so hard to go through this alone. I hate waking up everyday and even the sunlight makes me feel bad. The only time when I am slightly ok if when its dark because I know that if I want to end it I could. I cannot feel like that way when its day, because I cannot Kill myself when its day time. One day I took a nap to feel ok and of course had a dream about my ex. I could hear his voice perfectly and once I woke up I felt fucking empty. I am convinced this world hates me. Why does this have to be so fucking hard"
"What does it mean when I have lost all feeling possible (99% of time)? I do not react to love from my girlfriend or family at all or get happy triggers from it, i do not even cry anymore, i do not get angry at stuff (i just say fuc* it and brush it off), etc. its almost like I am just here in autopilot.

"I am honestly not doing so fucking hot. I have not been doing so hot for the past 8 months. I really do not know what is going on with me. At first I thought it was burnout from uni....but now I have a feeling that uni was my form of escapism, and now that I am graduated, I just feel like shit. I was an emotional mess back in April, and now I just feel numb. I still overly care about people and important things, but my mood has been so static. I am not happy anymore, I am not sad anymore, I am just....there? I am just so beyond exhausted. Past 5 years was so intense, with both school and personal stuff. I am an overachiever, my cGPA is a near 4.0, grad school is not too far. Career wise, life is good. I am at my prime, and I feel so confident in that. But in this year alone a close friend and my sibling were both suicidal. Decided to go out of my comfort zone and try out dating, the dude I briefly talked to turned out to also was similar. My parents barely were able to pay their mortgage due to unemployment. My dads health has been steadily declining. My PCOS got out of control. My sibling and parents fight constantly. My parents fight with each other constantly. COVID is still very much flourishing. What are the fucking odds. Every year I tell myself that the next year is going to be better, and I end up disappointing myself. Like, I can never catch a break. And literally I do not know anything about personal boundaries. I am so quick to commit to being there for people in my life, but I have realized that I am never there for myself. Apparently caring too much about others is a trauma response, and that totally makes sense. Being the eldest daughter in a dysfunctional immigrant family, I learned from a young age to set myself aside for others. Being a therapist, peacemaker, tutor, caretaker for my family members and all that. And now- I just feel like I am passing my threshold of tolerance. I want to move out, but I know that that is going to be financially irresponsible of me. I need to be there for myself, but a night of simple self-care makes me feel beyond guilty. I feel so fucking lonely, but I want to be left alone. I am so fucking sick of shit, but I have to push through. I am trying so hard to keep a mental grip, but I am so close to just crashing. Fuck, I need a hug. need to vent"

"there were rules to which obeyed, standarts...Living in a charade thy was all. No real purpose can save you when you are mentally ill. I have OCD non responsive to meds. Everday I lose a part of my identity. Constant fight beetween two spheres of my brain. I was a star dust and I am ready and fulfilled in life to go back to where everthing started. I love my friend Yamur which is a mix of passion and love and charity. I can do anything for her if I had been healthy enough.I love my family too they matter a lot. But I can not tolerate my daily melancholic suicidal depression and obsessions just for the sake of them. The world has no rules on grand scale no justice no purpose. we have to distract our mind and create and illusion each second just to forget we exist. Yes we exist and this must be a bad joke. We are walking to the eventual death of us each day. Some of us only suffer while some of us can be happy in their distraction.For example the girl I loved we are texting only Ilove her so much without even seeing her face and voice. Yet I know she will never meet with me nor can I touch her ever. On top of that void calls me. I always dreamt of jumping from bosphurus bridge. Before jumping I ll look to mu childhood photos family photos and the photos of the girl I deeply fell love in. I do not want to lose and tarnish this love. Call me coward probably right. Anyway sleeping pills and jumping from Bosphurus to crystsl blue current will be my choice. Maybe the only time I would be free just before dying. Such a misery. I will become a part of eternal silence until maybe I revorn again after for example another Big Bang. or maybe never who knows maybe we a simulation of a 4th grade student out of our real . And some day our universr will cease to exist to no avail.I want to thanks to reddit which is full of nice and also weird people. people who shows their true selves.I love you Yamur and it ll be forever.And my family do not morn after me for finally am I free.In another life brothers bye.

Is it normal to not know if you’re in a hypomania episode or not? i think i’ve only been able to identify 1 episode of hypomania so far and that was months ago because it was prominent after a long period of a depressive episode. some days i randomly feel really good and energetic mixed with irritability but i can’t really tell if i’m hypomanic or not
"For those who are not aware, England lost in the final game of the European Championships tonight, and I am obviously extremely disappointed, but I find myself wondering *why* I am in this position. I have sort of accepted that the best way I can manage what seems to be a life-long depressive disorder is to accept that things are basically as they are, and I do not have the capacity to change them - unfortunately, I do not have the strength of character or will to make meaningful, long-term changes to improve myself or my conditions, and opening myself up to hope of things improving or getting better *always* seems to be the first step towards distressing disappointment and feeling much worse. As crap as it sounds, I think accepting a constant state of low-level misery may be better than letting myself get excited at the prospect of wins, which then leads to things getting far worse when they inevitably do not pan out as hoped. Is avoiding the risk of relationships, new jobs, and new challenges the way to go? When medicated, I can just about manage being myself. I do not think I have the capacity to handle any serious slings and arrows that come from taking risks. Football and Wider Reflections"
"I use to have care for others and their opinions. I use to be do nice things like help homeless. The world has shown me that most people are selfish. Not just people but animals too.I have become detached emotionally. I only seek to please myself. If it helps, figure out the type of person I was or am, cheesy but I am something mbti calls an INFJ. I think others would take it negatively because me being selfish does not have any benefit for them. People are selfish. If it negatively effects them, they care but if it does not, then they do not care. I have been nice my whole life. It does not get you anywhere. And I do not say this out of being mean but it does not. My advice to anyone would be to be selfish because you are the only one who truly cares about what your desires are. If you do not do it, no one will. Of course this does not include pretty girls because a guy sees the benefits of fucking her and so he will go out of his way to accomplish this. But this still is within selfish intent. I am starting to not care."

"Maybe I'm just an asshole I have been recently diagnosed and medicated and my mood stabilizers have really helped. But today I was walking in the parking lot with my daughter and a guy in a jeep drove aggressively fast towards us and I gave him a ""slow down"" arm wave. Now I think if I was in a normal state I would have just ignored him but I felt confrontational I guess. He yelled out the window to use a crosswalk. It's a parking lot? And i called him some rude names. He then took a lap around the parking lot to again yell at me ""that's how you act infront of your daughter?"" So I doubled down and called him even worse stuff. What the hell was that? I wish I had just said nothing and now I'm dwelling on it. Maybe I am just an asshole."

Mine is from today: I cut open an avocado, and where the stem was it was all brown, but everything else looked fine. Tried to convince myself it was fine, made the whole avocado toast and when it came time to eat it...I was too scared of being poisoned/getting sick or something (I mean, can that even happen??) that I scrapped off all the avocado and now I'm sitting here with my plate full of damn avocado that I know was most likely perfectly fine to eat lol

Thought we could all use a laugh or something :)"

And it is not because I am not ready for a relationship, it has been over 2 years. I usually get all excited when hr gets me stuff but recently it has been all too much because I do not feel like I deserve it. I do not deserve all he does for me and in my state of depression I have no idea how I can even begin to repay him. I have no idea how I can thank him because I am so broke and I am broken. Every time he does nice things now I just feel like the worst person ever and it makes me so upset that he gives me so much of himself when I am so broken and truly do not deserve it. Obviously I have not expressed any of this to him because I do not want to seem ungrateful I am so angey"

"Are we neurodivergent? I was reading the post about crapping on coping mechanisms that was posted recently and I was surprised to hear that many people consider themselves neurodivergent because of their bipolar. 

Please inform me if I sound really ignorant! 

I was under the impression that neurodivergence is an innate difference in thinking, permeating everything you do and the brain is inherently wired differently. This is most often associated with ADHD and Autism spectrum disorders. 

I personally feel that although I have a mental illness, that when well controlled and stable I am “wired” the same as most people. My therapist described an allegory that stuck for me which was “Your personality is the climate, and your mood is the weather”. 

I think that my climate is “neurotypical” and I do not identify myself as neurodivergent, more as someone who deals with periods of mental illness. 

What do you think about this?"

"When I asked her how it happened, she said her brother had accidentally elbowed her in the face when they were 'rough-housing'. There was something about the way she said it that seemed a bit off to me - like she had been practising her excuse (or maybe that was in my head). Whatever the case it struck me as maybe a little weird that a couple of 20-something siblings would be play-fighting with each other like 10 year olds. This morning, after an absence of several days, she arrived at the office with a broken wrist. Her arm is in a cast and she has metal rods holding the broken bones in place."

"Everyday I see people just doing the same thing but not making any changes. I watch obese people walking into fast food joints. People just walking on this treadmill of work, spend money, sleep and repeat. Ever since I left the country in 2016 I have just been feeling like this place does not work for me. I do not want to become a slave to the matrix and live a boring life of paying bills and working some boring job and having to pay rent or a mortgage for the rest of my life. it is just stupid to me. But what I really realized is how depressing the US is to me. Seeing elderly people living on the streets, seeing the government slowly turn the country into what Orwell warned, and seeing people just sitting idly by and letting it all happen. I feel like it is a lost because to even speak yo about it. I saw a Jim Morrison quote about this and it fully resonated. I find myself not connecting to 99% of people here. Everyone is just so self obsessed and dull. I do appreciate how many different interesting people are on Reddit though. At the same time I believe people are more authentic on the internet than they are IRL. Regardless, I see alot of people doing alot of cool things, and feel a better connection with people here than in the physical world. I just want to make music and build my brand in peace, not having to worry about bills or paying rent and it is sheerly frustrating to try and do it here. I think I just have to go to Africa for a few months and be around my people. I realized that living in th US makes me depressed and I do not believe I fit in here"

"Man, when I thought these months were going good, nope it was preparing me for this 2 weeks before I felt on top of the world, nothing could stop me. I was getting over my health anxiety and was ready. I was also about to score a new job and leave this cruddy one. It was all going good, until the next week. I found out that the job I was taking was a total scam. Fine, time to just wait it out and try some online freelancing (fyi first time). Oh look a job opportunity! Nope two more scams that further irritated me (fun). Fine, I guess I will try to hang out with some fiends. I call a few people and text (no response for days). Now I am starting to feel the partial feeling of depression. Next thing I know, my school work began to pile up and was now behind (awesome!) But the funny thing is, the week ended okay for me that is until Sunday. Without any explanation whatsoever, my ex(who hated my guts after I broke up with her but I was cool with) dmed me months after our last talk. Ok, I am not upset or angry at her, she changed alot and is happy with her new bf (something I was hoping she would get) but this was the match to light the fuel. After taking to her, I began to see how much good stuff she is gone through the years and I (should not have done this) mistakenly started comparing her life to mine. that is where I took a total fall. I immediately blocked her because I was jeleous of her new life(mind you I wished for her happiness) because I was so insecure at the time. Luckily she dmed me in a unblocked account and that is how I found out i was not inheritly mad at her. Now I am just at the bottom of my life. I feel burnt out and just lost a good deal of hope. I am so tired of having straight up bad luck I want good things to happen (I also feel karma may have something to do with this)I am just done. The worst depressive wave this year"

"Hey you all. was not sure if it was better to post here or a different sub, but, I am struggling. A lot. I am currently taking 150mg Wellbutrin XL, 20mg Adderall XR +15 IR and roughly 1mg per day Suboxone. I was an opiate addict for about 4 years, started taking Suboxone last September, and now I am trying to get off it. I tried quitting it cold turkey a couple weeks ago and only made it 8 days because my depression just became absolutely crippling and I was having constant thoughts of suicide, hopelessness, lack of motivation, etc.So, I got back on the suboxone and now I am slowly tapering (for those of you who do not know, Suboxone is extremely strong, very hard to get off, and withdrawals have severe mental symptoms and last weeks to months). I know I will not make it unless I can figure out my depression. I know I need to force myself to start exercising daily, but I need to start doing other things while tapering so that when I finally get off suboxone, I am not a total wreck like I was when I tried to quit cold turkey last time.I know this is long, and I am sorry, but if anyone has any ideas I would appreciate it. I was thinking maybe looking into adding an SSRI, possibly one to take at night to help me sleep (another thing I suffered with while withdrawing), but honestly, I am not really sure. I just know I need to do something.TLDR: Opiate addict, been in recovery via suboxone for a year-ish, now trying to taper off, but struggling with depression already which becomes significantly worse when getting off the suboxone. What do? Suggestions for bettering my depression/adding another med?"

"PSA: Steroids And Worsening Of Bipolar Symptoms Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, so please always consult with yours when you seek medical treatment.

I don't see this talked about enough. It's flu season and many of us may become sick and be prescribed steroids. 

Steroids have the chance of worsening bipolar symptoms and may send you into a mixed episode or manic episode or worse. 

If you are prescribed steroids, please mention your bipolar diagnosis with your doctor. 

I'm sure there are cases of bipolar people that have taken steroids and have come out fine afterwards. I'm sure there are cases where a bipolar person is required to take steroids as there are infinite personally specific medical conditions and situations. But ask yourself these questions: Have you disclosed your bipolar disorder to the practitioners prescribing steroids? Are you stable? Are you medicated? Do you have the resources to get emergency help should things go wrong? 

I was sick last year and prednisone almost made me kill myself. I had no idea that steroids could make my bipolar disorder worse. I spent over a week in hell as it left my system. Apparently, it even awakens bipolar disorder in otherwise stable bipolars. If anyone has any evidence to the contrary or input or experience, please post. 

These might not be the best links, but maybe you guys will find better ones.

"I got diagnosed with chronic depression when I was 8, I am 19 and its only gotten worse. I cannot even function anymore. I did not even know I was different when I was little, I thought I was normal as a kid and everything was just fine, I had no idea that I was any different. When you ask anyone for advice all anyone will tell you is it will get better, look for the light at the end of the tunnel, after 12 years I have gotten to the point where I realized this will never end, Ill never get to a point where Ill be happy for more than a few minutes. THIS will never end, this is my life and there is no overcoming it. I decided at 15 that Ill give myself until I am 29 to find something to live for but I know in reality Ill never make it that long. I cannot hold a job for more than a year, I damn near flunked out of my first year of college and I am still waiting to hear back on if Ill even be allowed to keep my financial aid next year, if I cannot Ill have to drop out. I am in school to be a paramedic, the suicide rate for EMS is high enough to be offered free therapy and counseling, and who knows if Ill even be allowed to practice once I am done with school. I am at the point where I am just waiting for something to topple me over into downing my pills with some alcohol and calling it a day - If I get that email back saying I cannot keep my financial aid I know that will be what does me in. I have asked for help so many times from friends and family and professionals and it keeps going unheard, I do not know why I am still hanging on while knowing damn well it will never get better. How are you supposed to look forward to the future when you know there is none that you will be even remotely okay in? I am just so tired and on one hand I really do want to die but on the other I am scared to, I feel like I do not deserve to be admitted or anything because of that reservation and all the ERs around here I am familiar enough with due clinical rotations from school that Id be better off not even trying to go there for help. I am stuck and all I feel when I am sober is the slight anxiety I have surrounding dying, and that is not even strong enough to deter me without distracting myself with weed or alcohol or jerking off. I do not know what to do. How are you supposed to stay alive when you know there is know other side?"

so i would describe myself a someone who is pretty high functioning in term of living with moderate anxiety although in certain triggering situation it can become completely debilitating and a huge obstacle to making progress in my life on wednesday i have a job interview and i am just nauseated and so anxious even thinking about it it s only 0 minute long but i think it s 0 0 whether i ll straight up have a panic attack during the interview and i m absolutely dreading it the inability to speak to think in a straight line to remember anything to breathe properly feeling totally disoriented i m not trying to manifest it here but it s just the reality of how my body reacts to these situation and in year of my working life i have never come close to conquering it i have a wonderful partner i have been with for nearly a year now but she ha never really seen what anxiety can do to me when it get bad i guess i ve just been really good at avoiding situation that trigger it she s very sympathetic and encourages me to prepare but it s clear she fundamentally doesn t know what it s like to be debilitated by situation to the point of panic attack i tried to explain but she think if i prep then i ll just be able to speak without issue but it just doesn t work like that for me at all prep can only get me so far and half the time i ll just get a few sentence out then descend into panic i am so anxious just thinking about wednesday that i ve barely made progress with my prep anyway although i ll try my best to do some more over the next couple of day sorry this is just a rant and isn t a very meaningful post i guess i m just desperate for people to understand how horrible it is to feel so anxious and to know you re basically setting yourself up for a potential panic attack with an audience hope i can find my courage to get through it

"Help Coping With Hypersexuality??? I’ve been feeling super hypersexual for the last month and a half after about a year of having absolutely zero interest in sex whatsoever. And I don’t know how to deal. Help!!! 

As background, I have a lot of sexual trauma going back to childhood that I’m in the process of finding a therapist to deal with (life is hard without insurance). 

I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 6 years and he’s amazing, but he’s not feeling the same need to suddenly have sex all the time and the sex we have been having feels a bit unfulfilling and like I’m just going through the motions.

I’ve also had what was a harmless crush on a coworker for a while, but lately I feel like it’s getting into risky territory where I’m changing my wardrobe and behavior and it even got to the point where he (jokingly? I can’t tell right now!) asked me out even though he knows my boyfriend well. And I didn’t say yes but the best I could do was say that it’d make my boyfriend sad. 

And I’m afraid I’m going to do something I regret and hurt the people I care about.

I just was hoping that people might have some coping strategies. I could really use any help I can get right now.

Thanks!"
"The mixture I have bipolar type II, schizzoeffective disorder, adhd, and severe anxiety. I take depakote, lamotrigene, geodon for this, and hydroxizone for sleep. The hydroxizone does not work for sleep. Serequel and amatriptileye are too sedating the next morning. I am looking for suggestions on what to ask my psych. nurse for sleep. Do people recommend a psychiatrist as opposed to a nurse practitioner? I have not had much luck with nurse practitioners. I have been struggling with mania symptoms and panic attacks for a year now and have not found solutions. After my brother died in august I had a severe depressive episode that lasted from August until December and they would not put me on an antidepressant to pull me out. I was out of work from October to present because of this, and panic attacks that have been out of control, along with higher than normal blood pressure. This occurred when they put me on the lamotrigene. Higher anxiety and higher blood pressures. Any suggestions for all this mess?"
"Hi everyone, I want to talk about how people open up to others about their depression and how do you process those feelings. How do you feel when you talk about it? I try to talk about it with my mom because she offered to help me go and see a therapist and she asks questions. I know she loves me and she is worried but I cannot help but feeling overwhelmed when we talk about it and the conversation gets quite heated. I feel like I am going to get mad at her so I withdraw and I feel ashamed. She cannot help but give her opinion on the diagnosis that a doctor gave me and I feel like she is implying that I am just ""young"" and that I think too much. Sometimes it feels like she is disregarding my feelings.I try to tell her that what she says makes me feel like that but she takes it quite personally and ends up talking about her ""it is hard for me too you know ..."" or says that nobody in the family understands her and that she is fed up of having to talk to people in a certain way (like in an empathic and understanding way?). She also said that she is trying to remain neutral because she is afraid that helping me will backfire. Anyway, opening up to people is sometimes complicated and I am having a hard time to trust anyone and feeling safe to be vulnerable. Opening up is essential to heal but at the end of the day I do not think anyone can understand me and I feel alone. Getting help : How do you have the conversation with your family/close ones?"

"I created a list of things wrong with me.. and it's frikkin' long. So I'm having an off-day where I just feel empty and not feel like anything. Wanting to at least attempt to get out of it, I tried journaling about my self-attacking thoughts and it turned out to be .. a lot of them. I currently suffer a lot from anxiety attacks due to a very low self-esteem &amp; my financial situation (I'm living paycheck to paycheck without savings) and honestly I just feel down all the time.

I've talked to professionals in the past. However, it lead to nothing because of my own stupid stubbornness. I'm too hard to work with &amp; fix since I just believe I can't change, even though that's bullshit. I can't even start or finish anything, which makes this so hard to go through to fix myself. Honestly, I'm scared to death that I will always feel this way for the rest of my life.

Here're my dark thoughts that I wrote down in just a few minutes. They're a lot.

I'm not even sure why I post this. But I just felt like it, I suppose.

&amp;#x200B;

* I’m insecure

* I’m not a confident person
* I don’t have the attention span to read for a long period of time

* I don’t feel like a professional would solve any of these problems because I won’t listen or take it to heart; I just don’t care
* I have no charisma
* I’m a people pleaser because I feel unconfident if people won’t like me
* I don’t have a great personality
* I run away when things get hard

"Anxiety and heart problems Hi everyone, I was posting to see if anyone else suffered from anxiety and has heart issues going on as well. I have severe anxiety and I’m definitely a hypochondriac so I started taking Zoloft 3 months ago to help. However, for 2 years I have dealt with heart problems. My heart rate gets super high to the 170s at rest, I get dizzy, chest pain, and I have a low-ish blood pressure on top of that. I also noticed a couple months ago this feeling I get where I feel like my heart skips a beat and my breath gets taken away which I discovered was me having PVCs. I have done numerous EKGs which have been abnormal but my one cardiologist told me I’m a 26 year old otherwise healthy person so it’s fine. I did an echo and stress test 2 days ago so I’m awaiting those results. One of my previous cardiologists told me he believes this all stems from stress and anxiety and once I manage that it will go away, which I agree with to an extent. I had another cardiologist tell me that even if I’m stressed out having a heart rate sustain in the 170s is abnormal. I am also a nurse so I can’t tell if me having an understanding of medical stuff makes it more difficult for me to handle because I’m constantly thinking worst case scenario. I have this overwhelming fear that I’m going to be one of those people in their 20s that has a heart attack or other complication. I’ve seen people post on here previously saying their heart rate goes super high when they’re anxious but I wasn’t sure if anyone had similar experiences as me or knows anything about this. I’m sure I am overthinking this but I also don’t like the fact that I constantly have chest pain and a high heart rate."

"Everyday the voices get to me but recently the alcohol does not fix it anymore, people say they are tired but it is gotten to the point where i hope the alcohol takes me out so people will not think it was on purpose. Is there any point to waking up and going to work? Like what for? Work till you cannot physically work anymore then you wait to die? it is hard to feel happiness at all, try to do the things you love and nothing happens just feels like you wasted energy. If the mind is so focused on survival why does ot want to exit the chat? Broken"
i have gad and have been going through an emotional upheaval with my partner causing extra stress i ve been reducing my lexapro slightly a i felt it wa not working but now am more anxious than ever despite tiny change today i woke up full of dread to go to work no reason i love my job but it all felt too much a a mid ground i decided to work from home today instead of going in i still feel light headed and awful and have the added guilt of messing client around by changing the schedule or converting to online service what do i do how do i get myself to work when it all feel too much
"All I do is go through the motions. Everything feels like a chore, even the things I used to enjoy. I ruined my life. I hate myself. No one will ever love me again. Life is not worth living when you have to do it alone. I am just stuck here to look after my dogs, but even they do not bring me joy. I have no hope left. I do not know how much longer I can do this."

"I can say without a doubt I hate every individual reading this. I want you to die, I hate the idea of people so much. I hope god all of you get shot. FUCK YOU FUCK ALL FO YOU.

"I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and I’m so relieved to finally have answers. After a few years of considering that I’ve only ever been depressed I finally understand what is wrong with me. I’m reading through old journals and I can almost pin point each episode and determine whether it was mania or depression. I HAVE ANSWERS!

My manic episodes  and then depression and sducidal gestures.  I finally understand. It’s a relief and scary. I joined the community about a week ago so I can understand my condition all the more."
"l asked if there was someone else and she said ""no, even if there was we weren't in a relationship"". Fast forward 3 months and I'm finally over her and life is going great, then I got a text from her and we started talking again. During the holidays I returned to my country and I spent all month with her, this time officially dating. We always kept our relationship open, so we jokingly spoke about one night stands and if we had any during those 3 months apart. We both mentioned that we had one - after we stopped talking."
"Employer prying I have told my new job that I have a chronic health condition, but it is under control with medication and specialists. The manager/owner is REALLY pushing trying to find out what it is. I know legally I do not have to disclose, but this is starting to get uncomfortable. How can I politely and professionally get this to stop? Note there isn’t really an option for HR to step in."

"The past 2 months I have been overwhelming myself trying to figure out where I will live for my senior year of college. Who will help me move in? How long will the rent money I made working 7 days a week durring the summer last? Where will I buy furniture and food? How will I get around without a car? Who will I hang with when I get there? No one, because I have zero friends to see when I get there.""Wait are not you a senior? Why do not you have any friends to help you move in? Why will you have to uber just to get grocceries? Why did not you make lasting friendships durring your previous 3 years?""I did have a few friends before covid happened, but they have now all graduated.I do not know a single other person in my situation, ESPECIALLY at my college. I go to an SEC school which is a party school, and everyone knows everyone and has lots of friends. Not me. I AM that weird loner. And being in quarantine for a year has ruined my social skills, so I would not even know how to act around people my age without looking like a socially awkward weirdo. My life now is just go t work-&gt;go to the gym-&gt;browse reddit until bedtime. I have less than a month to figure out what to do. And I am scared. I just feel like an NPc who does not enjoy anything anymore.I have no idea how I am even supposed to enjoy my final year. I just do not look foreward to anything anymore. I do not know how I am supposed to look foreward to my final year of college after becoming depressed being online at home for a year, and not having a single friend to see when I return there."
"I always feel very egoistic when I am sad. There are thons of people out there with worse problems than mine and i still for some reason think, i have the right to feel bad about myself.

He died 2 months ago and I still cannot assimilate it, since because of the covid19 I could not attend the funerals or the hospital, I use marijuana and cocaine every weekend, and according to what I have read, they are one of the things that take me away the motivation to emerge, I seek no attention and never occupy reddit before, I am translating this with google translate, I really need help I am a 20 yo guy who is lost"
i m not the same person and i didn t like the person i wa before that so it s not even considered a loss but now i just stopped caring i genuinely stopped caring and it make me want to hate myself but the thing is im too exhausted to even hate myself i just feel like nothing just an empty space where a human used to be i ve stopped caring and it scare me i know the final step is when you stop caring and im at this step i don t care to pursue my passion or talent because whats the point why live a live when i will be forgotten why wa i even made like why even bother trying what even is the point in living if i can t be bothered to try

I have no hobbies that can make money, and even then, my hobbies become draining if i work. I tried streaming but I did not enjoy it after the first 10 minutes, I just felt like a loser. I do not know what to do, I have no SO and will never get one bc I do not have a job or good looks. I just wonder what do I do with my life? What do i do with my life?"

"It has been a few years since she broke up with me. And I love my new girlfriend, but it is a very different kind of love. Our relationship was short, not very deep, but the memories I had from it are perceived as the best memories I had in life. When I think about it, all pictures look so bright and colorful in my head, all accompanied with a feeling of pure joy. Every single moment I remember of is good with the exception of the day she broke up and the days following it. Sex was also incredible, even though I had several partners after her I was still unable to feel as good. I feel like this feeling is in the back of my head for a few years and dragging me down, overall decreasing my well-being.Can anyone give me advice that actual works, and not those that in theory should work? Any first hand experience with fixing this in your life? If I feel like this does it mean I should leave my current girlfriend? What if I want to commit with her for the long run, is it not ideal? Can anyone offer advice that works on how to overcome a person? I have zero to few friends, thus I am asking you, thank you!"

"I oftentimes want to kill myself, but I only feel depressed some weeks/days/months while being suicidal is always there, even when I am feeling great. So does wanting to die directly correlates to being depressed? Because ""hey I am not depressed I just want to kill myself"" does not sound very convincing, it just makes me wonder. I admit now that I am probably depressed but I spent years doubting myself and wondering if I was just lazy and worthless, nowdays I believe it is both. Does being suicidal equals to depressed?"
why am i always suicidal
"I debated for ten minutes what I should do. I didn't want to open the message completely and violate her trust that far, so I woke her up (which was a big decision because she loves sleep and has two tests today - I know I'm an asshole but she understands and doesn't want me going crazy while she sleeps), and yeah. That was that. She told the guy she was in a relationship (who doesn't check relationship status on Facebook ffs? ), and thanked him for creating a shitstorm."

"I know it help you alot if you see a therapist but not all have the money to do that, not all is capable to see a therapist if they needed to. I always want to see a therapist because I also have anxiety. Its easier maybe if we can afford to live a normal life without struggling financially. Me and my three siblings are still studying and living with my parents house, my parents work abroad because they receive more salary than here in our country but still its not enough to live a stable life. I also told my parents about my depression and anxiety but my mother think that I am just an attention seeker so I never tell anyone about it again. I just hope that I am living where my problem can solve easily, without struggling if I want to live the life that was given to me anymore. ""Just see a therapist"""

He asked if I wanted to smoke some weed with him, and I knew already from past experience that I tend to have very bad reactions to it. He told me that if I freak out then he wouldn’t let anything bad happen to me. I was having a pretty good day, so I smoked some weed with him. It was actually okay being high."

"i do not know what to do anymore. just graduated high school, not going to college. of the five real jobs I have had, I have quit three due to my mental health, and I am about to make it a fourth. i seek work as a source of necessary income, and to establish purpose, responsibility, and interaction with others.however, all of my jobs have been either too much for me to handle without becoming damn near suicidal, or my mental health is just flat out so bad that i cannot even function. period. my current job is not the worst, but it is inconsistent, overwhelming, and I have had even had an anxiety attack on one occasion and i often come home from a shift burnt out and crying.I have even looked into disability. technically my depression is debilitating and interferes severely with my functioning necessary for work, but i miss a single box for eligibility: unemployment for at least a year. i cannot go a year without a job let alone a few months. I am grasping for straws. i do not know what else to do. how to find work when debilitatingly depressed"

it s tuesday evening and i haven t been able to fall asleep in a few day because i can not stop replaying a sequence of event at work from last week i talked it out with my coworkers and i know that i wa in the right there wa nothing i could have done to get a better result and it s ok everything s cool let s move forward with our life k i would love for it to be that easy but that squishy asshole between my ear ha a very different perspective on the matter so we can t move forward we haven t earned that yet we have to spend an indeterminate amount of time meticulously dismantling and examining every minute detail of the incident my action and the reaction of everyone else involved buckle up and grab a barf bag folk it s about to get real whenever i have even a tiny stretch of free time the film reel in my head alternate between warp speed and slow motion depending on circumstance and timing every minute or so my brain get the ball rolling with really all the thing you could have done and that wa how you handled it idiot followed up with whoa you ve got nothing to worry about bae you handed that shit like a champ before circling back to what the fuck is wrong with you why why would you do something so heinously ridiculous this is why nobody want to be around you this shit right here and after that we get another no don t listen to that mess you are entitled to occupy space on this planet without apoligizing for your own existence but then that s hilarious see how far that attitude get you tomorrow after everyone ha had time to think about what happened and they realize what an immature out of touch self centered asshole you are have fun dying alone and unremembered and then every few minute the pattern repeat itself in an infinite loop of madness half assed self justification and shame this can go on for day sometimes week or month but it never permanently stop sometimes a certain song a smell a facebook memory or a half heard remark from across the room will launch my as back in time to tear myself to shred over an instance that ha been dead buried and forgotten by the rest of the human race except for me lather rinse repeat go fuck yourself wave of abject misery and self loathing interspersed with flash of contentment that might occasionally brighten thing up but it never really stop or get any better the best i can really hope for is the drop off in frequency that occurs after a few week or ideally i might forget about the incident entirely until i get hit with a trigger again at least
can anybody help with this i have a short minute presentation next week infront of about people over team i know it dosent sound bad but my anxiety ha gotten the better of me already dreading it and now starting to think of excuse to miss it also debating diazepam before it to help which i know isn t the smartest idea but lost with stuff to help

I find myself never quite feeling joyful about anything. I am so over living in my hometown and I feel so trapped here. I feel isolated and physically uncomfortable often. My lease ends in 3 days so perhaps a fresh start will help add some zest to my life. The routine of working 40 hours a week is draining and I hope one day Ill feel more hopeful One day maybe Ill feel okay

"A (very) brief summary of my story:I am a 28 year old male who has suffered from MDD, bipolarity, and mania for roughly 15 years. I experienced a lot of tragedy and trauma as a child/teenager and well, it stuck, hard.In 2010 I attempted to kill myself and was fortunately unsuccessful, although a part of me wishes it had gone as planned.I was homeless for a long time and a few years ago I turned my life around. I mean like, really turned my life around. During that period I met the love of my life. She is from South America and I am from the usa, so things were difficult for us, to say the least. But, we were making it happen We got engaged in February 2020. I have never been happier. Then covid hit. Which made things much much more difficult. Yet, we still managed to get here.Yesterday she unexpectedly decided she no longer wanted to marry me. For reasons completely out of my control. I am currently researching how to sell the engagement ring I never got the opportunity to give herKill me with a tire iron please I cannot wait to die"
"this life of ours is kind of fucked up is not it? going through everyday with this mental anguish is just so... awful, in everyway. even if some of us are lucky enough to catch a break, we will come crashing right back to where we were. i cannot escape. the only real way out is for me to ""disappear"" and even then I have fucked that up a few times now.I am so far beyond my limit. i cannot take it anymore, yet here i am. kill me and donate my organs to those in need. at least then I will have been some use to someone. I am nothing to anyone alive. completely stuck, giving up, self hatred, self abuse, pain."

"Not doing well My existential OCD is so severe right now. I spend hours online trying to find answers to unanswerable questions, I have to ‘check’ my and every other person’s actions, words, feelings to see if they are ‘good’ or just a way to cover up or distract from our misery ( hard to explain but makes sense in my head). Literally everything I used to enjoy I question and find flaws with and life feels like an unreal nightmare and I can’t stop questioning the nature of reality and it’s driving me insane.

I’m on Zoloft and buspar but they don’t seem to be helping. I have Klonopin but i just saw an article that benzodiazepines cause cancer so now I have no relief.

I’m seeing a somatic therapist for the first time on Friday and I hope she can help. 

I just want to wake up from this nightmare"

"I am honestly not really sure where to ask this but I am very confused by who I am supposed to confide in and for what.I am finding that my meds for depression are not working and my doctor said I should see a psychiatrist but then when I tried getting a referral to a psychiatrist they said my doctor should be managing my meds? My doctor also said he suspects that I have cptsd so should I see a psychiatrist to get diagnosed? Will that help me?One thing I do know is I need a therapist so I am in search of one but I am so confused about everything else because even medical professionals are giving me mixed responses. Thank you. Psychiatrist, psychologist or GP?"
@LindseyLobo How did you know?? I LOVE it!
"I have been seeing this girl off and on since the start of the pandemic (M43). I wanted a relationship, but she was going through a nasty separation and she did not. For the past six months, we have been going out as friends, and I was ok with that. We were supposed to go out right before July 4th and she cancelled last minute. I got upset because I was really looking forward to it and she had a habit of cancelling last minute. I got upset and she stopped communication with me. She said she was busy, and she probably was, but I keep running scenario after scenario through my head of what was going wrong.I have struggled with depression for almost 30 years and have never been able to seek treatment. I have come to the conclusion that this is why I cannot start any meaningful relationship. it is the self doubt and self sabotage that prevents me rounding the corner. I sent her a long text confessing my depression to her and telling her that all I wanted was for her to try and understand what I am going through. I emphasized that our relationship would never be the same and that the only other person who knows about my condition is my doctor. We had constant contact almost every day for the past year and half. She was going through a nasty custody battle with her ex husband, and I was there for her. I was hoping she would be there for me. Instead, she has blocked me on every social media platform and my number. It would have met so much to me if she tried to understand, but she cut me off. I am so embarrassed and feel so low. I just want someone to show me some compassion! Now she must think I am a creep.The only good news is that I have made an appointment with a therapist for next month. I feel so low and embarrassed right now"
"it’s the first relationship I’ve been in that feels “serious” and friends comment on how well we get along in public. We laugh a lot and we have the same sense of humor. I have been known as sort of a funny person and this is the first girl I’ve been with in a relationship that consistently makes me laugh hard. Plus she is very caring and sweet, a good friend. We have not had a serious fight in a long time, maybe more than 3 months."

Why is this guy so restless

"and I remember being depressed at 6 years old. 32 F. I have been jobless since April 2020, had to move back in with parents far away from where I was living, I have no friends, no prospects. I have not been social in such a long time that when I try to be now I end up stuttering and falling over all my words and fail to make any point or contribution to the conversation. I also have nothing to talk about because all I have been is depressed. I try to take up hobbies/ find things to make me happy, but I just cannot be happy or interested in anything. The whole job interview process is painful and the stuttering is just as bad. I have a lot of experience, but cannot blame them for not hiring me when I completely lack confidence and cannot put together a normal sounding sentence. I try to practice, but it does not work. The more job rejection I face, the worse everything gets. After being constantly rejected by jobs and guys I have dated, I have zero confidence left. I cannot even look in the mirror. I hate myself SO much. When I see my reflection I feel sick and disgusted with the person looking back. It sounds bizarre, but I have this really strange feeling of wanting to scrub my face off; I am so overcome with disgust I just want to physically scrub the disgust away. Last week I ended up looking like I had a severe sunburn after - it is such a strange urge that I had never experienced before. Now I am just avoiding the mirror altogether.I am so sick of everything. I just want to end it all. I have always struggled with depression, but this is the first time I have felt truly and completely hopeless. the worst it is ever been"

"i found a spot, but someone cut in and took it from me."
"He won’t give her access to their bank accounts. He refused to let her learn to drive, told her she wasn’t capable, that she’d get into an accident and kill their daughters. He’s violent, and he tried to kill himself in front of her after abusing her and that’s when she left. He is lying and saying he’s gone to more therapy than he has (she asked his therapist if he was going, no he hasn’t been), and he still refuses to give her access to their bank accounts or give her money. My friend has no options."
"Hi, I am Chris and I am 21. I live in Italy and I am new around here. I decided to join because... everything went downhill on these days. I am not sleeping or eating, I am working 24/7 and my body is collapsing slowly. But I could not care less. I need to find some help because I do not think I can resist for long. So, i know this girl since 2015 ish and we fell in love with each other really fast. I am the kind of guy that have that really old mentality where I can only love once. I can still have relationships but I never really loved someone that much. She quickly became my everything and I could not live without her. long story short, I did everything to make her happy and I worked hard for a future together. I promised to myself that this girl, will be the woman that will raise our children with me. I decided that she must be the only girl of my life, no matter what. and then Covid happened. we could not see each other for 6 months because she is nearby my general location but was in another region. So we had to restart after all of this time lost but we had a lot of fights instead and things were not going that well. Then, the worse happened. she was not sure about our relationship because we could not see each other for a lot of time but she told me to remain calm since she still had feeling for me so we will be together again soon. but I am not done yet. while we were in a pause, she met a guy. she was honest with me, I do not hate her. but the sentence changed. we will not be again together. if only we resisted like till her birthday ( a week later ) that me and her family decided to surprise her... we could have been together for like two weeks at least. but no. now she invited that guy, and her family is really sad and worried about me since they became mine family too. and now I am all alone. I still love her so much, I constantly cry about it and I am starting to let my life go. I cannot do a thing bc everything reminds me of her, we did so much together. idk, I do not want to move forward, I just cannot without her. and it is killing me the fact that another guy, even if a friend still, can be with her. but soon they will be together if things go well and I do not want to ever see that day. I am looking for help because a part of me thinks that life matter, the other half just wants to die. idk even know, I am so confused, I cannot explain how depressed I feel, I think about suicide too, I want to stop suffering. thanks a lot for your time, it means a lot to me, I hope the best for each one of you.. it is unbelievable how a single girl could change my life... for ever. plot twist: in a really bad way..."

"I feel like so much is just piling on. My already existing depression has been so bad for the past year. I stopped cleaning, showering/brushing regularly. Slowly but surely. I am ashamed and embarrassed. I am extremely broke and owe 3 months of rent that I do not have.I am anxious most days and have no energy or motivation because I just feel so low. Then tonight, while I was in bed I saw what was either a rat or a mouse. I have never seen one (mouse) in the summertime (usually fall/winter), but apparently they can about when its hot too. I am so scared. I am worried about being bitten. I feel gross and I really just want to sleep because its 2am but I am too nervous. I am poor, and apparently have rats/mice. I am extremely scared of getting sick. From anything. Least I WAS semi safe at home. Life is shit right now. I honestly just want to disappear. Thanks. saw either a rat or mouse and want to die"
"wanting to be seen I've spent most of my life craving sympathy and understanding from others, hoping someone would notice my struggles and help me but even when people do try to help me i shut down. i don't want to burden others with my problems and ik not everyone knows how to comfort someone who is experiencing extreme anxiety or a panic attack. but even when i turn down others help i still sit here going ""wow i wish someone would help me. why is no one noticing that I'm struggling?"" it's so stupid and contradicting in my head and i have no clue how to even begin to get over it."
"Can you hear other voices in your head? I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder around 4 months ago and since then I have been doing some research.

I can hear a couple of voices in my head, they are always making fun of my choices or telling me jokes.  I do not know any other people with bipolar disorder and sometimes I feel like i was miss diagnosed. 

Can you hear voices as well? 

Btw English is my second language please do not judge me hehe.

Thanks in advance."

"Its very hard for me to write this because I know I have people who love me and care about me. I am 27 years old now and have no clue what to do with my life, I work as a labourer but it is something I do not enjoy and spend between 60-70 hours a week doing it, I basically have no free time to do anything I enjoy. I often find myself frustrated that this is what my life has become. I would try and find something else but anything I apply for I never hear back from or not qualified for. When I was in high school I was very athletic, great social life and everyone thought highly of me. Now I am an embarrassment and I have gained almost 100 pounds. I gamble and eat/drink all of my money away and people think I am not good at anything. I basically feel like a walking joke, I have no idea how my life ended up this way. When I go to work and think of all of the things i would rather be doing it really hurts, my passions are slowly fading and I am turning into a zombie. I honestly feel like there is no hope for me and I am starting to wish I was never born. I am heading down a dark path and I feel it slowly get worse every day that goes by. I have lost the will to live"

"Feeling so down and helpless my depression is causing me mental, emotional, and physical pain. Really struggling today"
"This is not how I feel all the time but when I do, it hits hard. I have felt like I could break down at any moment for the past month or so. I do not want to mention it to anyone I know especially people who actually care about me because 1. there is nothing they can do about it, 2. People start to treat you differently 3. People get upset when they know you are upset and that makes me more upset4. Most people can probably tell I am not in a great place just by the look on my face and my tone of voice and prefer to stay out of itSo I am sharing my feelings with you wonderful people instead. do not feel obligated to try to help. It just helps me a little to know that someone is listening. Existence is pain"

"Does chlorine definitely kill brain eating amoebas? Sorry to spam this sub with two posts about this. but as I said earlier, I purposely snorted water up my nose after I vomited earlier, because my nose was burning really bad from puking. I'm in Florida right now where according to the CDC the brain eating amoeba naegleria fowleri is common. In a panic I researched the water quality and according to the internet this town's tap water is chlorinated. Does that definitely mean I'm safe from amoebas, or should I still be worried??"
you need a bath every day.
I'm going to the doctors soon to see if I have bipolar My mum has bipolar so we are assuming it will be genetic. I've researched it a bit but am stuck between the terms. I'm going to let the doctor diagnose me though. What I'd like to know is what to expect going into this and most likely coming out as someone with bipolar. Is there something I need to keep in mind? Anything I could keep tabs on to help the diagnosis? Any advice is appreciated.
"Excuse my grammar, English is not my first language. I am Male, 25 yrs old. Suffering from major depression, anxiety, avoidant personality disorders. Tried to kill myself twice almost 5 years ago. Mom died when I was 8 yrs, father passed away 3 yrs ago. I have been going to therapy since a month ago and I have started to feel more miserable. I like my therapist, she is extremely empathic and understanding. But sometimes she tries to put words in my mouth. I discussed about my problem of social withdrawal and anxiety. I am very hypersensitive person. While I avoid people because I have had horrible experience with people and prefer to be alone. I cannot emotionally connect to people. She said ""The problem lies in my thoughts. External forces are not majorly responsible for your anxiety"" Some of the opinions is hard to digest. I can understand from her POV. Eventhough I tried to change myself, it is very hard for people to accept who I am. it is true that my interpersonal skills are not the best. Does that mean problem lies in myself? Or external world does not have much influence for my avoidant personality? I have been hurt by people but I hate being lonely. Therapy making me feel much worse. Need help"

"Low grade hypomania is back...and I love it Before my GP put me on antidepressants and spiraled me into a year long crazy cycling that had me re diagnosed to BP I, my mania was a manageable, predictable state that had me making lists of frugality, cleaning like crazy, working out and eating healthy. 

I enjoyed the time, and the depression that followed was usually low-grade as well--general irritability and annoyance of friends, feeling like I no longer loved my boyfriend (which in stability, I found out I don't)

Over that last few months I have finally become stable. Until recently. My medicine has been spotty and once I felt the mania coming I stopped taking it at all.

Back on meds but still manic. I love the feeling. It isn't the crazy ""god is speaking to"" staying up all night redesigning a fish tank (why?) or hyper reorganizing that left my house a total disaster as I couldn't have the focus to follow through.

It's back to setting goals, making lists, focusing on healthy and happiness. Low-grade mania actually makes me SAVE money--I become obsessed with spending as little as I can (whereas the mania from antidepressants had me blow 20k over 4 months)

I feel like I'm enjoying living again. Stability is so... so boring. And the problem with stability is that I never learned self-discipline in the face of not having manic inspirations. It isn't depression, but my room becomes a complete mess, I don't take my dogs on walks, I don't try at work. Again, that's simply because I am so USED to feeling inspiration and energy from mania, that stability requires discipline and vigilance that I have never had to learn.

So why should I go back on meds? To me, this is worth the depression. I become ultra-functional. Functional enough that I can ride out the depressions as people become used to and aware of my energy and motivation. I understand the mania from before, the mania that had me re diagnosed as Bipolar I--that was purely induced from meds-- is unsustainable. I didn't even enjoy it. But this is something altogether different. It is ME. I don't know 'stability', that is not me. I don't even dislike it as I'm going through it, but now that I'm experiencing the energy again I don't think I can go back. 

How am I supposed to write poetry, paint, play the piano, clean, focus on my healthy--how am I supposed to do that stable when I have no knowledge of self-discipline that makes you drudge through you chores while you're tired and uninspired.

I almost feel bad for 'stable' people--to never experience the inspiration that we have. On the other hand, comparing stability to this makes it a no-brainer that this is better. Even the depression was apart of me before. Stability is a whole different person, someone that I don't particularly like."

"Why do I always want to delete all my social media accounts and go MIA. Were all getting older, I know I cannot expect to act the way I want them to act but I feel like everything I do is wrong and they will just shade me in someway after we hang out. I always over analyze my friends behaviours, the way they act around me and I start to overthink that everyone hates me. I do not know if its the weed putting words in my head but I do think I am somewhat weird or crazy. I connect to strangers way more than friends, after knowing a person for a while, I hate them lol but it is a temporary feelings. I cannot seem to be with people, I have been to myself for so long now especially during the pandemic that made me even crazier got me thinking when could I ever be normal.I should definitely stop smoking weed because it brings my alter ego that I do not want to be, I just want to feel loved and not judged. I want to be all for myself but not really"

I have been in a rea''y long period where my self esteem was at its lowest and I thought that I was cured eventually but now I know that in the deepest of my soul I hate myself. I always putting so much pressure on me for tiny things that do not matter and it become so stressful I cannot handle it no more. I spend nights thinking about myself with regrets about things that I have done or just self hatred. I have so much difficulties to express my issues so I am doing it here and I only want to be happy and to be able to talk to someone and to be reassured. I hate myself

And I’m not sure if it’s because I can’t get it over with him here or the depression itself but I’ve been really irritable. His jokes aren’t funny anymore, I get visceral when he play fights with me, I get so angry at him I want to cry and be violent. It just sucks because he was the absolute last thing thats brought me any type joy these pasts few weeks.

"Heyo there!I try not to think too much about my depression but as of late it seems late I am going further and further into a bottomless pit of despair.Some background. I am 35 years of age and for about 10 years of my life well since about 20 I was living with my grandmother and taking care of her. Scrounging by and doing all kinds of jobs to make money. My dad committed suicide, we were not close so I was not too overtly affected by it. I got his life insurance policy so I used that money to pay for my expenses. It lasted me about 10 years and looking back I was pretty neglectful with my money. Anyways moving along to about 4 years ago. I apply for Federal Student Aid and that helps me out. I am getting college paid for as well as getting money to keep me afloat. There were a few close calls when I could not pay rent due to not having enough financial aid. Now to recent times. I learned that I no longer have any more financial aide and that my father before he passed ruined my credit so I cannot even qualify for personal loans. I have enough to last me through the year but after that. I have no resources to keep me afloat. I work at Target and I pretty much told them I need to work all the time because it will be the only source of income. But working retail is not very stable. I have no degree, no financial backup, nobody to help me and I am an anxiety/depressed mess right now. That and I do not know of any places aside from factory and sales that I could work where I make enough and is pretty stable. I feel like I am just going to be a giant mess with nothing and nobody come next year and that is scary as hell.I am scheduled to see a professional and I basically am going to see if they can help me get my life on track. I am old and I feel like it is too little too late. If anybody has any advice or anything I would greatly appreciate hearing from you! I mean at this point I am just stuck we are in endgame now"

Am I being lazy? I do not know. I am tired. I just showered and i did not even want to stand up. I wanted to get out. When I did, I just went back to my shitty room and that did not help.

let's open with bismillah ™
i hate college. i know its not suppose to be easy but its way too stressful. i might fail this class I am currently in and i do not know what my parents will do if i fail. i just want to be able to focus on me and my life and well-being for once and not work and school. i want to take time off school but I am scared because my family would hate me for it and idk where i would work. id feel like a failure too if i did that. i do not know what to do. 1 in 5 college students are so stressed out they consider suicide. i am that 1 in 5.
Life actually is pointless and meaningless. I do not even know why I bother to get up and work and strive for shit anymore. Everything feels so stupid. I hate this feeling but it just creeped back up again. I am so tired Life feels so pointless
"Thinking that everything is useless because things will not get better for you, you do not deserve anything because you are not enough, you are not good looking, not talented, not appealing, not worthy and so on...so you stop doing everything and you just wait for the time to pass...sorry for my english The worse feeling of depression is hopelessness... 23f"
no i don t want to kill myself but i want to die i reflect on the last 0 year of my life and see nothing good and can t see the future improving my mom just died my longest relationship recently ended terribly and with abuse i have addictive behavior i never seem to kick and i don t see it changing i ve gone to therapy i m trying to find another good therapist but haven t heard back from voicemail i ve left so far if you have a response i appreciate it but please don t share vague generality tell me your personal hurt experience will carry more with me than it get better or similar platitude i m hurting i need to hear the hurt others have been able to endure to feel encouraged i never thought i could feel so empty and so sad and so angry i hate living right now i never thought i d ever feel so bad edit i have nobody i have my job and i have my dog my family isn t the support system i wish it wa i don t have any real friend i ve tried reaching out but everyone is busy with their own problem
"And my defence mechanism to it is that, what if I pull a sneaky on life and end it before life takes good things away from me?. I am not going to die though. Like idk how to explain. I do not want to kill myself as such, but if something accidentally happens to me, I have no interest in surviving. I want to die accidentally because I do not have the guts to end my own life. Having an overprotective father does not help the because. Tired of feeling like everything good is going to be taken away from me"
"Why do I randomly leap up? I get sensations sometimes in my head where I just leap up and feel wrong? I have health anxiety, is this something else?? Anyone relate?"
i didn't love you at first.
Literally have a birth defect that makes me incapable of making friends. I do have a girlfriend who is mentally unhinged that makes my life a living hell but I have zero other options so I stay with her. I just feel alone and that without true friendships and a healthy relationship it is all pointless. How do you continue when everything in your life points to ending it?
"Sorry this is long but I doubt anyone will even read this but I just need to get this off my chest. \---I have always struggled with depression since I was a young child. On and off numerous medications throughout the years, nothing worked because, at the end of the day, I did not have things in life that brought me joy as others did. I was an awkward introvert with anxiety and depression. I fought through depression for years and really busted my but to get a good job and work up and create goals for myself to really not let depression get me. I have a great job. I am so grateful for what I have and yet.... Life. Just. Feels. Pointless. I feel like i am drifting with no direction and I cannot seem to pull myself out of this pit. Everything this I do just does not make this feeling go away. Therapy and acknowledging why I have attachment issues and things from my past doest change the feelings. I understand my past, I understand my issues, but knowing this or talking about it does not change my obsessive thoughts and deep depression. Medications never stopped my thoughts, sleeping pills barely helped my sleep. On top of my already struggling chemical depression, I feel my life has just gone down the drain of everything I worked for. Ill skip the childhood and long list of life trauma and jump to the past year topresent. Since I worked hard to overcome those....My fiance and I broke up because I walked away from a toxic situation to try to better my life. He was bipolar. Anxiety medication made me gain 40lbs (I was underweight before so this was not making me obese but it still did not feel good and cannot' seem to shake it)I have lost 6 family members in the past 3 years including my sister. My fiance told me not to bother him with my grieving because it was annoying. So i learned to just deal on my own. When I was trying to move on from my ex, my male friend tried to rape me at a party. When I tried to talk to anyone about it everyone just told me to get over it so i did and kept on moving forward. I moved my job and gave up the home I owned to be with my ex, who changed his mind. Learned to appreciate it and enjoyed the ride. I am living in a temporary apartment trying to decide where to live with no furniture bc why bother if i do not stay. Lived trying to appreciate how nice it is in a new place. I had a pay cut at work due to the pandemic forcing me to live in a cheaper place far away and now have to travel 1.5 hours to the office each way. But that is okay, more time for audio books. I did not let any of those things get me down. I tried to just find happiness in everyday things and get through. I knew walking away from a bad relationship would be hard, but that it would lead me to a better life. Things started to look up, I got a raise, I started working out daily, was really putting in the effort to say yes to things instead of no, spent a lot of time outdoors, read as many books as I could. Joined a few dating sites to keep my options open to love. A year after my break up and moving out we had a long weekend at work for the 4th. I got depressed, no friends were around, i felt so lonely and pathetic. Went running, to the pool, I got myself some nice craft beers and just started reading, watching funny movies and just tried to pull myself out of this. Even treated myself to sushi to try to cheer me up and just enjoy my time with myself. But by the final day of a long weekend alone, after many many months alone. I just broke down and cried. Ended up drinking a bit and just let it out. Felt my depression. BUT then. Random burst inside of my overwhelmed me and i said to myself...I will NOT give up. I am awesome and great and I know someone will see that. I am fun to be with, loveable, funny, I have a great career, finances growing, i got this, made a visionboard. So after 1 year of dating sites, I have talked to hundreds and hundreds of guys. I feel like I can tell pretty quickly when I click or do not, and really have not experienced any conversation of interest. I still knew id find someone but was picky for a conncetion. People told me it was because i was not open or wanted my ex, but I really was open, I just could not find the chemistry I was looking for in a partner. I really try to add to the convo and ask questions and elaborate to build connections, I am really good one on one building connections. But then... an incoming message from someone new. just another guy that took the time to write something out but the responses had so much personality to them. I started getting excited to see them come in. We moved to another chat app and starting messaging from sun up to sun down every day for a few days, then he asked me out. He was busy but wanted to make it for the following weekend. We continued to chat all day every day completely connecting on so many levels. He really confirmed he was interested in me and was so excited to meet me and was clear i was what he was looking for and everything we chatted about was deep and connected and understanding and always followed up that we were still interested. Nothing really changed and then in the second week of chatting, pics, and videos. We were writing back and forth, he usually initiated and we both continued the convo. nothing happened or was said but it one second after i respond I was left with ""unread"". Never heard from him again and it is been about a week and he never even opened the message. I sent another one a few days ago just expressing I wish him the best and enjoyed chatting and such but thought we connected and were still interested. That was never opened as well. I had not been blocked thought, maybe that was something as my mind obsessively overthinks it. Anyways, skip to a week later. I got too attached to someone I never met. I was walking on air excited to chat with someone I was so into. We talked too much it honestly felt implied we would clearly be dating after meeting and that was just a formality. I get it, I was stupid to care before the meeting. But I could not help it. I was still chatting with others to not put eggs in a basket but no one had my attention as he did. It felt easy and effortless. I took a break from online dating to recoup and ground myself. Obsessive thoughts consumed me. What happened? what did I do? He was so reassuring and thoughtful. I could not sleep for a week. I could not control my thoughts of failure after a year of trying after my fiance and i broke up. I stared at my computer all week watching emails and emails come in with no desire to respond. Depression has taken over. I decided to take to reddit just to let my feelings out. I am finding work so pointless. Making money for what? To be alone? I had a few friends, they were depressed too getting out of bad situations as well and trying to find love. All of a sudden LAST NIGHT. I HIT THE WORST LOW continuing into today. My friends have all left, two found new fresh love and are on the moon with joy after barely anytime being single (inspired by how happy they saw me talking to that guy) and they took to themselves and found people quickly and enjoying their start and really do not want to deal with depressed me. I was the one being so optimistic to them, telling them they got this and really trying to radiate positive energy. I am happy for them I wanted to see this as the universe showing love around me as if it was close for me too....but the universe slammed me with the same day, another death. Another male friend cut me out because I told him that i did not see a romantic future with him and he kept trying to manipulate me to want the same things. It got ugly. My ex reached out saying he wished he could have loved me but just does not and does not know why he cannot care about me but wished he could. I got so low, made a call to everyone on my phone list that I talk to, and no one was around. I went for run. Talked to a shrink who told me just to meetup with someone and get out. (that is always the advice) No one was around. Walked for 4 hours straight. Called a psychic just to give me some hope, something. Just ended up making me feel worse. I am now sitting on my computer writing on reddit drinking whiskey out of the bottle realizing that I am defeated. I think my depression has won. I tried to overcome all these situations, better myself. \*\*\*Now I am realizing i feel more depressed a year out of my toxic relationship than I ever felt in it. Wishing i had it back because this feels worse. I cannot get myself to work. I am distracted in my mind all day every day. I cannot make myself leave my bed. I feel left behind. Like everyone is moving along and no matter how hard I try. I keep getting kicked. I stare at the ceiling for hours on end. Everything I tried to do to stay positive came collapsing. Donated some money to some charities. Tried to volunteer but I get anxious in groups. Bought some nice things incase I got a date, to make me feel good. Did a juice cleanse to boost my health. Increased my exercise. I was going to my apartment pool, gym, anything to get myself out and about. At this point now. I cannot even get myself to watch tv or a movie, cannot read a book, cannot work. Every time I get a mere boost of energy to be positive I get more news that brings me down. Staring at a phone checking for that message that never comes. The psychic told me to change my energy. I feel like everything I do has failed and I am in such a dark place right now. I see loneliness or the company of people I force myself to be around since I am an introvert and do not connect with just anyone. I cleaned, I decluttered, i did all these positive things. Even feng shui and crystals around the place to create good energy. I thought I had the light at the end of the tunnel after that long weekend, but now, i am at such a low i really cannot get myself out of it. I do not even have those small moments of pulling it together to clean or shower like I did before. I will probably get in trouble at work but I wish I could care but just do not. Happiness should not depend on other people, i know this. But what do you do when nothing brings you joy. I was happy alone for a while, i liked myself, i saw myself as a catch and worthy of love. But now, I just feel kicked and defeated as nothing will ever change and all the men I like do not want me. The men I do not see a connection with romantically try to hurt me. or manipulate me. If life is settling, what is the point. If all there is work and exercise. I just do not see the joy in life. I give up. I am really really sad right now. I feel my life is pointless. Like is life really just holding on every day? There has to be more than just holding on. I was able to work through a lot of things but now I do not feel it. I do not feel like life gets better. I just feel defeated and at the lowest darkness I have ever felt. I overcame things for what? I feel so dark and low. Thanks to whoever is reading this and letting me vent this, long annoying rambling. I have hit my lowest low in life as of today...I just give up"
"I am just curious, do you think these 2 things are related? So for example, if someone lives in southern California or coastal Spain, where the sun is out most of the year and the weather is quite warm and pleasant, are they 'happier' than someone who lives somewhere with 4 proper seasons (including winter with clouds/some snow, etc.)? let us just say these people (in either location) are fairly happy in their jobs/careers/lives and are paid a decent amount to enjoy a middle to upper middle class life.Is anyone in this subreddit reading this, living in such a place with year round mostly warm, sunny weather? If so, how is this life exactly? Are you happier living in such a place? Or not. I suppose this can all be very individual. I am just wondering if living in such an environment could make someone 'happier'.If you Google what are the happiest countries in the world, all of these countries listed are in climates with 4 seasons and some pretty harsh winters. Interesting:**The 10 Happiest Countries in the World:** **Finland. For the fourth year in a row, Finland is number one when it comes to happiness.** **Denmark. Denmark remained in the number two spot this year. ...** **Switzerland. ...** **Iceland. ...** **Netherlands. ...** **Norway. ...** **Sweden. ...** **Luxembourg. ...** Happiness and weather/sun"
"My life is fine, I am pretty lucky actually, but I can stop feeling utterly miserable, bored and alone. there is nothing to do and I cannot bring myself to do anything. Anytime I start something, I always want to stop after a couple of weeks. This has been going on for as long as I can remember. I wish I could just maintain an interest in something. I feel left out and unable to connect with others too. I just feel so trapped. I am just so unhappy. I have tried so hard to change it, but I always have this cloud hanging over me. Surprise surprise, another post about being miserable"
"I’ve been stable with my job and got a raise! I was a seasonal team member at a retail store, and my manager decided to keep me on and moved me on to sales lead. Around this time I felt myself coming loose and the depression was coming over me. My anxiety began to grow to the point where i felt like the ground was shaking below me all the time and the walls were creaking. I got an intense ptsd flashback where I acted out. There were some nights were i was SURE that all the cameras were watching me and people in photos or paintings were spying on me. This would be around the time work would get complicated and I would need to leave, but for the first time ever, I pushed myself through it and made it! My raise was 50¢ but it really does add up to a lot. I also got a store key, so I can close on my own now! (This is probably not a big deal but this is the first time ever for me)

I’ve been working there for about 2 months now. It doesn’t seem like much, but this is the longest time I’ve kept a job in a while. I’m so happy for making it past those episodes, and I hope to keep working there until I make through my medical leave and go back to school :) "
"For all my life I have battled with depression. It started ever since the age of 6 when i lost all my hair due to a condition and left me inhibited and paranoid of the world. I have gotten better recently (I am 20) but i still have this extreme sensitivity to other peoples perception of me. Any sort of rejection and i go this depression pit that i cannot get out of for a while. Luckily i have not experienced any devastating events such as a death of a loved one, but i am deeply afraid when the inevitable does happen. I do not think when my parents eventually die ill be able to sustain myself. I feel like I am too fragile to live for long"
Udiehzjx mapagal na naman right

"I tried the search function but mostly saw that a lot of you feeling with depression are not getting the help you need from your parents. My teenage daughter has depression that is developed into suicidal thoughts. She is getting counseling and is working with her doctor. But I need help as her father.I am looking into what NAMI offers but are there books, podcasts, or other websites that I should check? I am specifically looking for advice on how to support her. And how to deal with my own strong feelings that I am experiencing.And do you have any advice? I have tried talking to her about what she needs from her mom and I, but she does not seem to know. What could your parents do to support you? Resources for parents of teenager with depression?"
I do not know if it can get better. It has not. I want to end it

"Am I in an abusive relationship? I have been with my partner for a little over 9 years now. We have had our ups and downs. I've done things in the relationship during manic episodes that I am not proud of. I've sought sexual relationships (mainly sexting) with others, been emotionally abusive, and quite manipulative. This was primarily during times before I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 and on a solid medication/therapy regiment. Now, I feel like I am the partner they need.

Howerve, and here's the rub, I have a sinking suspicion she is not the partner I need. She isn't supportive anymore and is somewhat condescending. She is constantly reminding me of all the past pain I have caused, and when I bring up that it was in the past she just says that I am not taking responsibility for that pain. Recently, she has gone so far as to comment on my appearance, calling my beard pubes and asking me to shave so she can find me attractive again. She brags to others that she got me to shave and belittles me in front of friends. She fights with me anytime I bring up a change that I wish to see in the relationship. She has commented on my weight. SHe has commented on my ability to be a father. She has accused me of having inappropriate emotional relationships with friends. 

I am honestly not sure if deserve this. I did emotionally cheat on her. I have verbally accosted her. I have been mean, aggressive, and manipulative in my own. These actions are mainly when I am manic and being confronted. I become incredibly defensive, to the point that I will be this way.

I know the relationship sick and that we need to speak with a couples counselor, but I am afraid that my partner will just listen and not change. Now, she used to be quite supportive. She took me in when I had no place to go after coming back from Afghanistan. She dealt with my PTSD. She has loved me through so much. I just am hurt by the way she is currently treating me."
"Tingling left chin and other parts - should I be concerned? Hi guys,

So straight into it - I was stressing (panic attack probably) about my brother’s health (He got Leukaemia a few years ago) because I had thought it had came back. Also been pretty depressed thinking about in the past 2 months (never knew how bad it was). 

Now when I was worried about this, I felt a tingling sensation on my left chin. This was around two weeks.  Maybe 4 times or so this has happened, however recently it feels like it has been more recurring (not sure if focusing on it has to do with it). I was super stressed thinking I’ve got cancer so I got my CBC, which there was no issue with.

Now I went to the dentist today and told him about the tingling. He said to me to get an x-ray and he really wasn’t sure why it was like that. My wisdom teeth had came through and he was pretty stern on me getting it checked. That scared me a decent amount, he said that x-ray will show what the problem is.


Since this ordeal and getting the all clear after the CBC, I will get random tingling throughout my body for a few seconds in small sports it goes away. (As soon as I move my limb or finger, they go away) I’ve also been a bitch more itchy of late and get the occasional sharp pains.


However apart from this I’ve been fine (no other symptoms) Eating a lot, lots of energy, no headaches, not feeling tired, no blood in stool and no night sweats. I’m just concerned what this could be. Should I be concerned? 

Thanks guys love you all!"

"I wanted to know if there is anything I can for my brother. He says he is constantly depressed and hes self-medicating with alcohol, and he already has Cirrhosis. Everyone says he has to want to help himself but it does not seem possible for him. A recent hospitalization for Cirrhosis made him stop for a time and he was doing well but hes drinking again. What can be done? Drinking Driven By Depression"

"I do not know if this is correct sub reddit but here I goRecently, I met a close friend of mine and was narrating the story of my breakup with slight annoyance and dark humor and proud that I was strong and nothing affected me yada yada. He pointed that I did not feel anything for the relationship that is why I could not cry and it infuriated me but I let it pass anyway. It has been almost 5 years I have cried and it has started to bother me. It has been a long time(the breakup) but there are moments where I just smile malevolently at myself and think about the scenarios where someone is whipping me or stabbing me with glass, leaving marks and bruises but I do not cry or any sort of extreme scenarios. I googled 'why cannot I cry even if I want to?' and it said there might be a chance I might be suffering from melancholic depression. Is this melancholic depression?"

"As a person with depression, did you have much awareness during an episode as to how badly you were treating your significant other? My partner has been slowly withdrawing for a few months now - we are at the point where the only words spoken to one another are good morning and good night. It is like living with a complete stranger. Prior to this, we had always been very close, affectionate and in sync. We were not only in love, but best friends. I hate using the word 'were' but I really do not know where we stand anymore.Should I be concerned that he seems to be acting relatively 'normal' around his family and friends but completely shuts down when we are alone? He has admitted he is depressed but the fact that I am the only one seeing it makes me think I am the because. He assured me that it was not, but I still have some doubt. Awareness while depressed?"

"My mum was explaining to me that depression is a choice, or excuse that people use. She was explaining to me that she was depressed until she decided not to be and decided to play a different character This is obviously very frustrating for me to hear as someone that is trying their best every day but still not meeting their parents expectations. A part of me is even wondering if maybe she is right and if I just tried harder maybe I could do better? My parents think depression is a choice"
i don t like this 9 malarky i should be out seeing my friend who i haven t seen in month stupid work
"For such a long time I have lived in that small space of my basement appartement. It was one small room and a even smaller bathroom.The last 5 years of these 19 were the worst. I had night terrors about beeing burried alife. The appartement made me feel weird after some time and my life got to the bad side once I started living in the basement. I had no more drive doing anything, there was no energy or believe in myself. Just watching the internet. I barely had 2 friends that i saw maybe once or twice a month.But after one night terror where i dreamed I was stuck in my appartement for the rest of my life (I literally saw the windows dissapear and a stone wall behind them) I jumped out of bed and ran out of the door and stood naked in the staircase with my heart racing. I slowly realised it was a dream but there i stood there naked and thankfully no one saw me. So i just went back to bed. But the night terrors kept on comming. After a while i seemed to loose the skill of keeping track of the night terrors.I just barely woke up letting out a loud scream every night for a few month and went back to bed sometimes without realising what happened the next morning. But truth is no one could hear me screem down there in that ""hole"".This made me realise that I am in a prison and need to get out. I need to change something. I did therapy and after such a long time of having no job just sitting in front of my screen all day in the basement i finally found a job. And the appartement that i now live is on the top floor.What is so weird now i can finally see the world! I never saw humans in my basement appartement and now i can see people walk on the street! I can see the rain falling! I can see people sit together talking with each other. I was so isolated for such a long time i thought it is normal to be alone and just browing the web.I think now that I am 36 years old, i want to make more of my life now after so many years spent in isolation. I want to move now maybe ever 5 years to see more of the world. I have a huge list of things i want to do now and i hope i can.You guys would not believe how fucking bright this appartement is where i life now. I have a nice balcony this is such a great thing to have. And the appartement i am now in has huge glass walls behind the balcony so every morning the sun is shining into the whole appartement. I must say the first mornings i thought to myself ""wtf its 5 am why is the sun soo bright??"" because in my basement appartement i never really saw the sun.I do not want to say basement appartements are bad but its the time spend below earth that can drive you crazy. Or me at least. Anyway I am so relieved that I made it. After 19 years living in a small basmement appartement i finally found a job and was able to move up!"
"I don’t enjoy being awake or alive I find it tedious, wake up with nothing to do, no reason to be alive, all the goals seem meaningless. What’s the point of going to bed if I just wake up again to feel the same, empty, sometimes I don’t even wish for a gf or anything of the sort, just someone to talk to, I find them and three things happen, I either push them away because I’m not good at anything else, they loose interest, or just leave, but almost every time I fuck shit up."
oh man wa ironing jeancjumbe s fave top to wear to a meeting burnt it
"I was stupid to believe going to the doctors would help. I was stupid to believe medication would help. I am still me. No amount of medication or counselling will ever change that. I do not know what my purpose is on this earth. I cannot hold down a job. No friends. Most of my family cannot stand me. I have felt this way from a young age and I am now 25, it is never ending. I have never really reached out for help before but I was scared that I was getting close to ending my life. it is all I was thinking of. I am told I will have to wait two years for counselling. The medication has done nothing but put two stone of weight on me so now I feel even more crap about myself. I am in a dark hole and only I can pull myself out. It gets harder to pull myself out each time I fall. I wanted to try putting my thoughts out there instead of bottling them in like I always do. To anyone else out there struggling, you are not alone, even though I know it feels like that sometimes. you are not alone.PS sorry if any of this is against the rules, this is my first post. Also sorry for bad grammar, I never finished school because of this stupid disease. I was stupid to believe it would help"
"I have suffered depression my entire life, but from 2017 - 2020 I finally felt like I had conquered it. Then COVID hit and I had to isolate. I had to work from home and it felt like I lost my life.Now that vaccines are available and things are starting to return to some normalcy, I just cannot snap out of the COVID depression I went into. I am completely unable to function at work and am getting into trouble. I have lost all my confidence and desire to do anything other than sleep.My previous depressions were always drug related. Either taking my meds incorrectly, or dabbling in drugs that threw me overboard. This time around, there are no drugs. I am doing everything I can to be healthy. Good diet. Try to get good sleep. Tons of exercise. But nothing is snapping me out of it.Maybe it is the WFH thing that has me down. As much as I hate commuting to work I just cannot seem to focus or think anymore. Never had that issue in the office.My workplace is now putting things on me that I cannot handle. I am so stressed Constantly and have no confidence nor desire to do any of the work. I want to just give my 2 weeks and walk away but I am terrified I will not find another job since my qualifications have always been lacking. But how much longer can I take the stress? At some point I am going to be driven over the edge. Whether that be next week or 3 months from now. But I am too scared to look for another job with how I am feeling. What will be different anywhere else? My career is a challenging one and I do not feel up for the challenge anymore. I do not know if it is just COVID or if I have just changed as a person. Is it just a matter of going back into work and feeling like a functional member of society again? Does anyone else feel this way? COVID depression has made me unable to function. Anyone else experience this?"
WHY I DEG AN YES
man im too fucked to be in work
"Only thing keeping me from ending it all is being loss drunk Unfortunately I’m not drunk enough yet but I just made it to the convenience store to stock up. I’m so sick and tired of this, dude"
"Can’t concentrate I have so much work and homework to do and I’m really struggling because everything just feels kind of fuzzy and confused. Probably because of the meds.

I have a random ADHD medication left over from when I used to get those and I am trying to talk myself out of thinking I should maybe take that. Or some herbal pill that’s similar.

Maybe I should have some tea or something. I hate that I have so much trouble functioning now. But I just need encouragement or support to not take something that might put me on a path to mania. I know I shouldn’t, but…"

"When i was 12 my dad had a stroke, I am 21 now. I was the youngest sibling between me and my brother so i could not help. I was not able to help and now its really starting to show. I used to cut and i stopped 6 months ago because i met this amazing guy who i love. He helps me through it most of the time but he does not know how to help me now. All through high school i had no friends and i was bullied a lot. I hated myself. I had been sexually abused and physically abused in most of my romantic relationships. And me and my bf have been working through my insecurities. But on to the real problem once i got into college (which i moved 6 hours away from all of it) i struggled to make friends. I finally made a few and they were very toxic people to be with and they graduated. This past year i grew close with a small group of friends. I got into this relationship and at first they were upset cuz i did not hang out as much but they grew to like him. Me and him had a major fight i did not want to be alone so i called my friends. They immediately blamed my boyfriend and said it was all his fault. I started the fight it was all my fault and i explained that to them but in their eyes he did all the wrong. Later that night he proposed to me and i said yes (theirs no ring yet so we agreed on just still saying bf and gf until there is a ring). This upset my friends again and they did not like the fact i was still with him.Its a month past that fight and all of my so called friends went camping without me. I never got an invite but someone who they barely hang with did which kind of makes it hurt a lot more. And they have been posting on their storys about going out and drinking and doing karaoke all of which I have never been invited to this past month. Which really hurts but it also made me realise something. I have never been to a Halloween party but they all went to one this past year. They all planned each others birthdays and we did nothing for my 21st because i did not put it together. Shortly after the fight one of them turned 21 and they did not plan it but i also was not invited and got told the line on it was just a last minute thing so not everyone was invited. I saw all their storys and i was the only one not there. All of this hit me really hard when i thought about how i was never really invited and if i was it was always last minute. And i also thought about how this is our senior year and Ill have to see them every day in classes and work with them because We are all theatre majors. I do not know what to do anymore because i cannot cut myself I am 6 months sober. And i do not want to drink or smoke to forget and have another addiction. I am just not in a good place and my bf can see that but nothing helps how i feel. I cannot cope"
i m fine i m fine i m fine until once again i m back in the pit and i m wondering how long do i need to keep doing this for when i stare at my computer screen another fucking 9 day of meaningless clicking so i can earn barely enough money to survive comparing myself with other people my age depresses me i m not so successful and i probably didn t live up to anyones expectation including my own but the more i think about it based on all my trauma and self hatred where i am kinda make sense but the thought of i need to continue living like this idling just living in the same page everyday why i have a vacation booked and then what i come back to the same meaningless routine every time after a vacation im more depressed that my life is how it is do i want to change sure how i don t even have the energy or motivation nor do i have the strength or idea some day i feel like im living in my own paradox or dream that my life isn t even real the past few week i been reliving my trauma and all the shit i went through continuously in my head why i don t even know maybe i m trying to understand myself all i get are mood swing bad attitude and burst of anger maybe i should get on med

"Had a freak out at the dentist I was at the dentist to go get a cavity filled, I was somewhat nervous at first but nothing intense, it wasn’t until they gave me laughing gas I started getting derealization and started feeling weird and told them to stop and take it off, after they removed it they continued and put this rubber thing in my mouth, then I started to freak out because I wasn’t able to breath through my mouth because of it, and when I was breathing out through my nose it started slowing or stopping a bit because it was making my throat stop a little, then it made me gag and they had to stop the procedure, it was embarrassing but at the same time I was disappointed, I wasnt able to control myself, usually I breathe in and out through my mouth but it felt different and weird to only be able to breathe through nose.
I’m doing the procedure again in 6 months, I need help to calm myself down"

"Spinning out with health anxiety Hi all,

New post, struggling big time with health anxiety, to the point that it is becoming hard to cope.

I'm 36 years, old, I have two kids, currently nursing a 1 year old. About 4-6 months ago, I started losing weight. Initially I thought nothing of it, I figured it was just being a busy mom!

But fast forward and within that time, I caught just the most random viruses, and badly. I caught a flu that immediately turned to pneumonia. I caught a viral rash from my 4 year old niece. My weight kept dropping.

At this point, I started to become understandably anxious and curious as to what was happening. I had bloodwork during my pneumonia that came back ""normal"" in her eyes. But I noticed today there was elevated platelet count and low lymphocytes. Which are commonly linked to cancer of some sort. Why did I google it?

I'm just spinning out, because I lost my dad recently to a very rare aggressive cancer. Something just doesn't add up. I'm just scared that it is something seriously wrong. I'm getting more bloodwork done to hopefully alleviate my worries now that I am healthy... it could just have been related to the pneumonia, and the weight loss to nursing, anxiety and being a busy mom. But I can't see her until next week, and it is just torturous waiting.  

Any tips on how to cope? Similar experiences?"
"he was my best friend since highschool, she was a girl i really liked. my parents let him live at my house when his parents kicked him out, and he started dating the girl that i really liked behind my back. im not gonna go into too much detail about the drama but in short i kicked him out and they both hate me now. there were some not so nice comments going back and forth. the other day they moved into an apartment together after being together for like 3 months, but i just found out through the same person who initially told me that they were dating, his ex gf [22F] that he has hit her on several occasions."
Been relaying on optional sedative pills for battling anxiety.Right now I finally felt peace. I have not felt actually relaxed for a long time. I am proud of myself for staying alive during rough moments. First time in five months I do not have the urge to take sedative
"I hate myself. I hate myself so fucking much. I do not want to be here. I suck, and I cannot talk to anyone anymore without bringing up how shitty my thoughts have been lately. Seriously, I cannot be a friend; I can just talk about my pathetic existence and how I would love for someone to just save me. I am so far beyond broken. I reached my breaking point a long fucking time ago. I am done. I am tired. I am exhausted from all of the stress my mind has put me through. Like, has not it been enough? it is seriously relentless. I feel like it is been enough, but it just will not stop. I hate it here. I miss being happy. I miss waking up and actually looking forward to doing things. I am tired of trying to find safety from my thoughts. I am tired of isolating because I am too fucked up to be a friend right now. Like, seriously, I just want things to get better, but they are not. I do not know why this had to happen to me. I really do not. I really do not know why I had to be one of the people this affects. I seriously cannot endure it. I am empty. I have had enough. Like, it is taken all there is to take, so please just stop. There is nothing.I want nothing. I have no ambition. I do not want anything, so just stop. Please stop because all I want is to find peace. I am just venting."
"Atypical antipsychotic induced mania? or akathysia? So my pdoc increased my Solian dose (amisulpride). When I started it at 100mg, it threw me into a hell of akathysia. Unbearable, wouldn't go there again. It was one of the most horrible things I've experienced with meds, alongside being knocked out with Seroquel. Now it's at 200mg and 2 days after starting it, I felt my blood running through my veins, couldn't stop moving and pacing and wanted to cry. I slept, hardly, waking up a lot during the night. And when I woke up, it started again. Though this time I didn't want to cry. I took my train to go to school, started singing at loud, pacing and having a big smile on my face. I'm now trying to work, since I have exams coming in less than a week and one homework to give on Friday. But I just can't concentrate. I keep focusing on everything else like that girl who doesn't give a shit about me but she's so beautiful, I'm pretty sure I could get her. Or my friend's birthday which is important or the friends I just should go see today, tomorrow or this weekend.

"I feel like an imposter I feel like I don't actually have bipolar. I was diagnosed but I feel like I might have been faking it. I don't know, I'm on meds now and I was diagnosed years ago so I don't remember. My mom tells me the way I was acting was very scary but I think I might have just been acting. My family always notices when I'm off of my meds but I think it might just be because I'm myself again. Is this feeling normal?"
i had to take my friend to the airport.
"Also, to answer the million dollar question everyone has, ""How does this happen to someone who outearns her abuser by a factor of 6?"" I wish people talked more about the other side of financial abuse. We hear all about the men who financially abuse their partners by prohibiting them from having a job, or denying them access to bank accounts, and that sort of thing. There's also the side where they monitor every account and become completely terrifying if their higher earning partner so much as buys one cup of coffee that they didn't approve of. They spend all her money on random crap that they can pass off as household expenses."
they are not bad people though it my fault they ignore me school drive me crazy and i think ill never be really comfortable with the way life is i dont want to die but i really dont want to live

"You own it Possible controversial post here but I speak from my own experience. I've finally come out of the depths of the darkest, longest depression I've experienced. It took perseverance, self advocacy, accountability, and surrendering when it was too difficult to cope. Oh, and tons of therapy. 

From all of this I've learned that I own my own happiness. No one else is responsible for it because they've got their own to worry about. It's my body and I also own the right to know what works best for it. Meds, eating the foods that make me feel my best, moving my body, journaling my thoughts. All these steps pay off. 

It. Just. Takes. Time. I'm the world's most impatient person and the universe is always teaching my ways I need to slow down and smell the roses. Enjoy the simple things and little moments. All these things add up. 

You all can do this for yourselves and more. Keep up the good fight!"

"I have been getting more and more depressed over the past few months about this to the point that every conversation with my mother turns into an argument or screaming match because, to be quite frank, I cannot stand her as a person, but she barely works because of medical reasons, has no support system other than me, and I care about her enough that I cannot leave her on the streets. I pay for all the bills, including rent in a shitty duplex we have lived in since I was in high school that has so many problems but considering I am the only one paying bills, I cannot afford anything better. It would literally be cheaper and more freeing to be living with an actual roommate that splits the cost of everything instead of my mother who pays for nothing, but I cannot.To top it all off, she is smothering. She gets offended if I do not want to spend every waking minute not at work talking to her and will cry and throw fits if I just want to be by myself. She treats me like I am 16 rather than 30 and paying all her bills and literally throwing my life away to make sure that she has a place to live.I am just so depressed. I have no time for me. I rarely go out because my friends all think I am weird for living at home, and fuck trying to have a romantic relationship. My life is essentially over until she either dies or I win the lottery and I hate thinking that but its the truth. Idk. I am sad and had to get this off my chest. Thanks all. 30 and still stuck living at home with my financially and mentally unstable mother."

"Honestly I do not know where to start. I have had anxiety since I was little, I do not necessarily have a stresser more like if I get stressed it makes my anxiety ten times stronger. It used to be barable I would draw go for a walk or distract myself. But over this past year its been pretty rough, my parents have my other sibling a to be concerned with and I can tell my parents do not understand when I tell them I am sad or anxious and that I do not have a reason to be. I did start to see a therapist in this time and she recommended I start medication, I was honestly a bit apprehensive at first since my family has always been very anti medication. But I decided to start it after having a terrible anxiety attack. Its been three days now and the anxiety medication is making me super sleepy to the point were I almost fell asleep. And I was just wondering if I should continue and if it was normal I do not know if I should stop taking my anxiety medication"

"I could go at any time and have no regrets. I am pretty young but I do not feel like I need to continue living. Life has been fairly good to me. I am just too tired to go on. If I died, people would care. But give them a year or two and they would get over it. I am not suicidal but I just do not have they drive or desire to continue living. I hope I die of natural causes soon. I am not even suicidal. I am just fulfilled with the life I lived."
"Many people here, but not all only think people ""deserve"" to have trauma if they were hit every day as a kid but growing up in an isolating, emotionally blackmailing environment as a kid is just as harmful. you will basically have a depressed child that grew up with zero healthy sense of identity or self talk who thinks there is nothing wrong with him or her because they grew up ""middle class"". They end up isolated by almost everyone who is their age and does not even understand why. It does not even stop after one is young either or when you graduate HS. kids like this or (""us"" I guess) grow up to be the guy in college who only stays in the dorm 24/7 or goes straight from work to home every single day of the week. and girls who grow up like this will not end up like this so much, but will keep getting in one relationship after another, where the guy only wants one thing from her and basically every time she finds out the guy was just using her for sex or validation. And of course this vicious cycle leads many women to think all men are bad when they just keep meeting other people who are mentally ill (but not in the same way maybe her brother who grew up the same would be)Hope you guys found understanding in this post or related to it well I feel like we as a country (the US) do not do nuance and mentally ill people suffer for that"

"Just started the process of getting diagnosed, I’ve spent years in denial despite obvious signs Hey everyone, to start I’m a 21 year old female living in the United States. I come from a family that has a close history of Bipolar and ADHD. My grandfather has pretty severe bipolar and due to his refusal to fake traditional medication he’s an addict and has been separated from my family since I was a child. 

I’ve shown signs of being bi-polar for a very long time now, was diagnosed with ADHD, got on the meds for that, but still struggled significantly. I knew everything I was experiencing pointed to Bipolar II, but with it being so taboo in my family after my grandpas actions I refused to ever admit it. 
However now after talking with my psychiatrist he strongly believes I am bipolar and we will start a more in depth diagnosis beginning soon. 

I have mixed feelings, I’ve known that this was most likely the answer but I didn’t want it to be true. I hate that I have to be the one in my family to carry the “bipolar” role, I know they will look down on me and assume I’ll end up the same way that my grandpa did."

As someone in there house is no longer going to be living with them as a mutual agreement. I get along really well with some people in this agreed group and they are far more enthusiastic and keen than the others I mentioned above. I discussed with this group prior to the free slot that it would be lovely to live with them if possible and now that they have a slot it's actually possible. Since that happened I agreed to live take the slot with them. Having a house with them (five of us total) and I think it's in my best interest as they are a tight friend group meaning communication to sort it out is easier and they're more assertive - four of them are also taking the same subject as me.

I bust my ass day in and day out for my wife and kids. Bills never end. Food is always needed. Car repairs are random. Now since she is been put on best rest bc of a high risk pregnancy an is bed ridden I have had to take multiple days off of work. Bc of that I was fired. So guess what that means. More late bills. No food and no repairs. I am sick of this shit. I am trying to progress in life but I cannot bc of shit like this. I am tired of being broke and struggling man. Why is adulting so hard??!
I feel really guilty. I slapped myself in front of Nmy bf while I was having a panic attack. I can tell he is really upset. He says he will be ok but he is wondering how he can trust me to never do it again. I feel like shit.I know I did it to hurt myself and him and it was not ok and it was abusive. I talk to my therapist on Wednesday. I took a half pill of my anti depressant just now. I am so scared I will not be able to get his trust back. TW: self harming......I slapped myself 3x in front of my boyfriend
i have severe eco anxiety sometimes it s so bad i have a breakdown and think how can i possibly go on with life if it s headed somewhere so awful i m always worried about my future ever since i wa a kid however most of the time when i m doing okay i want to keep living and i want to do what i can to make that happen i so often see people saying such morbid and pessimistic thing about the future like they ve already given up and i find this so disheartening i also don t think many people realize what this attitude doe to people mental health it is incredibly harmful this kind of opinion breed consequence and make more and more people feel the same way i just want everyone to think about what they say on the internet and how it can be harmful anger and negativity don t do any good so let s not waste time and energy focusing on the bad that wa done rather we should focus on what we can do and how we can help no matter how small the worst thing you can do for the planet is expect someone else to save it please remember it s never too late to save the planet edit i wanted to add something marketing it a powerful tool study have shown that fear mongering doe not work and just creates despair and inaction people need to believe the planet it saveable to save it so when talking about these issue please try to leave the intense negativity aside also i don t want everyone to feel like the world is on their shoulder i just want to do what i can to create a more optimistic attitude towards the future any small change you can make make a difference

Thankfully my ultrasound looked normal, so I wasn't as worried anymore. Then, I was dealing with an upper respiratory infection and my symptoms lingered for so long that I thought I had strep--which, thankfully, I didn't. But I've been experiencing so many more stomach pains these past few weeks and last night I was awake for what felt like the worst acid reflux I've ever had!!! I'm still feeling it today :( I don't know if it's GERD, an ulcer, or could even be side effects from the birth control I'm using... but of course I think it's a million different horrible issues..."

"I frequently ghost all my friends and come back out of nowhere but its different right now. I want to ghost them and never keep in touch again. I think this is because of my depression and social anxiety (although I could never tell because I am not diagnosed). I feel a burden to them, like they would be better without me from their group. I feel like I always bother them and I always act weird. I feel like I am a fake person when I am with them because I am lifeless and I pretend every time that I am okay when I am not. do not get me wrong, they are not toxic and they are really the best friends one could ever ask for but I just feel like they do not deserve to be with someone like me. Everyday I find myself being buried deeper and deeper into isolation and I push everyone away. I do not know what to do.... help. My depression is becoming worse that everyday my mind is always filled with suicidal thoughts. I do not want to exist anymore. I want to ghost all my friends and never show myself again"
