"Anxiety about my appearance separates my life in two sides  Hello! Today, I (18M) fully realized that I cannot function properly as a human being, unless I'm directly seeking acceptance in others. This translates to me not showering, not brushing my teeth, not shaving, not even washing my hands when no one is going to see that I am clean and ""normal"".

  
 I recently started college, I've been making friends and generally having a great time, this, if u look at it from the outside. 

  
 Inside my head, I just cannot get the sense out of my mind that someone is going to think less of me and criticize me physically, because of my clothes, my face, my hair, because I have a gray shadow even after just 30 minutes of shaving, because somehow I smell bad, etc. I have crippling anxiety just thinking about someone criticizing my looks in their heads (And don't let me start with my personality), basically all this converts into me having a sort of ""Double life"".

  
When I need to go outside, I do all the work I can possibly do to try and look nice, smell good and be a nice person. But the moment I'm in my home, my mind unconsciously switches to a gross side, I don't take care of myself in any way type or form, suddenly I am mean, lazy, antisocial and want to die once again. The cycle repeats day after day, I've been trying to make myself go to the gym and eat better for months now, but my body just doesn't respond, every fiber of my mind tells me that I can't do anything right, I will always be kinda ugly, kinda fat, and kinda gross, so why bother trying?

"I recently got diagnosed with GAD and need help with how to cope with potential panic attacks Monday I have a panic attack and was diagnosed with GAD.

Last night I had one and this morning when I woke up I almost had one but I managed through it.

So far I've been outside and that helps me but doesn't make it go away fully.

I went to eat at a restaurant and right when I walked it I got panicky and couldn't eat my food because I couldn't hold it down and I had to swallow the 2 bites I did take WITH WATER.

I know this is temporary and I plan to work out and get a therapist and MAYBE take meds but is there anything I can remember to know for next time?

Panic attacks make it feel like I'm having a heart attack or anything life threating.

I should enjoy life but ik this is something that will take some time to deal with.

My hands shake a little and I still have a fast heart beat even when I don't feel panicky. It also feels like a pit in my stomach is waiting for a thought to pop up for me to panic.

"There is always light at the other end of the tunnel! Just a little backstory; I have had hypochondria that has steadily i creased in terms of severity, since late last November. Over this period of time I have been worried about; going deaf, having heart disease/dying of a heart attack, going blind, having the Hantavirus, having lung cancer, and the most recent one - skin cancer. Throughout all of my fictional illnesses, even with the consideration of how rare they are to my specific case, I continued to believe I had them. I mean heck, I live in Australia and there are only 15 cases a year of the HantaVirus out of the whole country. Didn’t matter. My brain knew I would be in that 0.00000062% chance of getting it. Although of this considerably unrealistic thinking, I still believe that deep down I knew I did not have the virus. Enter, Skin Cancer. Out of all of my fears, this one really stood out to me. I had an ‘oh shit’ moment where I realised my petty fears before where nothing compared to this beast. Due to the fact I am a relatively avid golfer who plays without sunscreen and typically without a hat, this fear was so real to me. Book the doctors in, a 16 day wait I shit you not. In the beginning of this wait I was fine because my worries were on other things. However, approaching the date I developed absolute chaos inside of my head. I head to google and establish... “Yep... must be Stage 4 skin cancer, this is the end.” For the week I could not attend school, maintaining the fear there was a long road of chemotherapy, doctors appointments and eventually death, ahead of me. Today I finally go in to the get the skin check. I was essentially prepared to have my life torn to shreds if I needed to get a biopsy, and then to wait for the results of said biopsy. Doc looks at practically every mole on my body - nothing. No stage 4 cancer. No risk of death. Just, nothing. Although other worries have taken the limelight of the skin cancer, I maintain a sense of happiness and humour about how much I work myself up. How much I google every single one of my bloody symptoms. Not just I however - we all do. This story was to simply let people know that there always light at the other end of the tunnel and I cannot say it enough - stop googling your symptoms. If you are really worried about something, get it checked up with your doctor ASAP and put your concerns put to rest by the professional! ",anxiety

"Stiff neck and head aches, worried this could be be bacterial meningitis after ear infection? About 6 days ago I started getting strange head aches. I felt a sudden, short sharp pain on the left side of my head which was followed by extreme warmth and a panic attack. Since then I've had sharp head pain come randomly for a couple seconds, then go. It's usually on the left middle side of my head, but sometimes happens on the right. I've also been having bouts of pain in the back of the head as well. I haven't needed to take medicine for this as the pain comes randomly and isn't painful enough to need relief.

"Brief mourning period for 4 months of stability Well, it happened again. Hubris is indeed my downfall.

I tried taking Vyvanse again, at a lower dose than the previous dose that made me manic. And I was OK for about a week before the symptoms started showing up. Namely, lying (about anything) and some risky behaviors. Luckily, not drinking and drugs, but I did take a hit off of a vape pen, which I know is super bad for my brain (no matter how much analog weed I can smoke.) I decided on Saturday to stop taking it.

And Sunday I blew up.

We were having a disagreement about how to best spend our day on Sunday. I wanted to stay Very Busy, and he wanted to take his time. Which is no big deal at all and shouldn't have been what set me off. But it did, and I was in the History of Pain.

My History of Pain is a mindset I get into when manic brain meets remotely challenging parts of my relationship. Suddenly, I am the victim of circumstance and have been forever and will be forever: He doesn't love me, he's shown how he doesn't love me in every action, and on top of that, I don't deserve love for how terrible I am and the terrible things I've done.

And then I'm hitting myself in the head over and over and over, and bashing my skull into anything I can get my hands on.

And then it subsides, and I'm crying, and he wants to get away from me, and I don't understand.

And then it's quiet, and he's mad and I'm still crying, and it seems like I'll never stop and we'll never be happy again.

And then it's quiet, and he's quiet and I'm quiet.

And then we're in the car and talking about the news, and all I want is to be held, but that's asking too much too soon.

I should've trusted my body sooner- there were warning signs that the Vyvanse was going to push me over the edge, and I went willingly. And why? Because Vyvanse would help me achieve my goals, surely, but at the cost of myself and him.

Everything has a cost, and this cost was too high. Sure, he and I are OK now, but there's the threat of so many next times, and eventually, he'll walk.",bipolar

"Drug advice I am 26 and have been diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder after a manic episode that lasted a month and a half. 
I’ve dealt with it my whole life but never saw a doctor for it. 
In the beginning I was given an anti depressant and Adderall for ADD. 
The Wellbutrin (anti depressant) made me horrendously depressed and mixed with Adderall incited violent, irrational and unpredictable behavior. 
I then was prescribed Lamictal for my mood. 
All three of those sort of mellowed me out. Then I decided to stop Wellbutrin because it made me incredibly forgetful, even to the point f frequent black outs and loss of time/days. 

So now, I am currently on Lamictal and a very low dose of Concerta. The concerta is doing nothing. 
I have horrendous ADD and my memory is pretty much wiped clean every week. 
I am also extremely EXTREMELY tired mentally and physically every day which is not ok because I am a runner and an avid biker but I haven’t been able to work out in weeks because of this exhaustion.

"Vivid Nightmares I’ve had bad dreams since I can remember. I have journals from when I was 8 describing my nightmares. Consistently 5 nights out of the week. They flare and will be worse sometimes. Lately, the past few weeks, they’ve become unbearable. Screaming in my sleep, waking up crying or hyperventilating. More concerning, I often have 3-5 min upon waking where I do not realize I’m awake and I feel that it is very real and absolutely what is happening. 

I had a bout of post partum depression early in the year but have adjusted my meds and my day to day has been overall much better. Obviously, the holidays are stressful for most but I feel that I handled it normally. I am terrified to fall asleep at night. I usually take sleeping medicine and have found they are absolutely worse when I do not take it.

Obviously, this is part of my life that I can’t seem to shake, but I can’t understand why it’s been SO much worse lately. My question: do you have constant nightmares? Does this just come with the illness? Is it my anxiety dragging into the night? Is there ANYTHING I can do?

"Bipolar Boyfriend Hi everyone, I'm new here so please go easy on me if I make a mistake.

My boyfriend (whom I've been dating for over one year) has bipolar disorder. When we started dating he was in a hypomanic phase, luckily he got out of it in a month or so, instead of it escalating into full blown mania or another psychosis. He's had psychosis several times in his life, and it's been difficult for him sometimes. He needs to take medication daily.


I have some questions about certain behaviour and would like to know if this is common with people who have bipolar disorder.


-Being indecisive. He'll say one thing one moment and when he's with other people, they'll be able to change his mind in a minute. He'll tell me/promise me one thing one moment, but then completely abandon those promises and stop caring.

-It's very easy to talk him into doing something, that he usually wouldn't have done on his own. I'm talking: drinking way too much and suddenly just smoking when he quit smoking for months. He also has a hard time when I ask him about this type of behaviour or when I get upset.

-He used to be very sure about our future but ever since a couple of months ago, he's been doubting things and he hasn't been sharing his feelings with me, or telling me how he feels, even when I ask him. He's tried to break up with me two months ago, to which I said ""are you sure? Do you want to give it all up?"" (Calmly and respectfully not mad) and he ended up not breaking up with me. He's been threatening to break up with me again.

-He often gets really tired and sleeps till late afternoon, he's been doing that for months. He lost motivation to look for a job as well. He had a job interview but he cancelled last minute, last week. He was too anxious to go. I often feel as if he's just very insecure.

-He'll say that the reason he never responds when I'm talking to him (irl), is because he just can't think clearly and his mind is just blank. (However I think this could be because he doesn't like to be confronted when he's lied to me)


I've never experienced him in a depressive manic state before, and he doesn't feel anxious when he's outside, he doesn't feel as if they're spying on him and stuff. Which he definitely did when he was experiencing hypomania. He believes the craziest conspiracies when he's actually manic, so I don't know what this all means.

It would help me if y'all could really enlighten me on this subject. I was hoping to talk to his therapist about this tomorrow, but he has been ignoring me and suddenly is hanging out with friends (he's out with one friend who's done hard drugs, right now). He says he's never done harddrugs but this friend does get him to smoke and drink too much when they're out together.

We had fights several times last week and yesterday, but he is just refusing to make up, ignoring me and instead just seeing his friends or he'll sleep over at his parents' place. (Even though I don't live with him, so he could just stay at his own place, but he always feels the need to go to his parents, which is why I think he's insecure.) Any advice? What do I do and what do I say to him? It's been difficult for me to understand everything which is why I'm here. It's also been difficult because him changing his mind constantly is so confusing to me, I never know what he actually wants because he'll constantly tell me something else.",bipolar

"99 problems and hypomania is all of them I’ve been fairly manic the past 2 or so weeks, sleeping maybe 4-5 hours on a good day/night (I work at a 24-hour hospital) and eating just enough that I don’t crumble every time I stand. Additionally, I’ve been having relationship problems that have been overwhelming me to uncontrollable tears every second that I stop and think about my life. I’ve been go-go-go nonstop, working 70 hour weeks because I couldn’t say no when I was asked to pick up shifts, and have definitely not been chill towards my body. 


I‘m now starting to feel the repercussions of the past few weeks— my body is dragging, my words don’t come out right (even the kids I work with called me out on it), and my thoughts would get a reckless driving ticket if they could operate a motor vehicle. I have to work 11pm-7am tonight after waking up at 5 this morning to work 7-3pm, not sleeping after, and barely stomaching a chocolate bar for dinner. I’m incredibly anxious about my body giving out on me at work and I don’t know what to do to make sure I can maintain during this shift. ??



If anyone has advice, I would greatly appreciate it

"I thought Bipolar was going to run my life. I'm so glad I was wrong. This is a celebration point for me and I wanted to share it with people who would understand the significance.

I've been receiving treatment for Bipolar II for over a decade and it's never been easy to deal with -- until this year. March/April is one of my depressive times and, instead of being crippled by my emotions, I was proactive. I spoke with my psychiatrist early-on so that he could make the right medication adjustments to keep the episode from getting worse. 

For the first time I feel like I'm managing my Bipolar, rather than it managing me. I now have hope that I can continue functioning as an adult as long as I use all my skills and resources. 

Anyone else have something to celebrate? ",bipolar
"People often say that depression is like a mask or cloak that utterly smothers the real person underneath, and I see that now. I went from a happy, driven and interested person to someone who cannot even keep their room clean and it is destroyed perhaps the best relationship I ever had. I feel like my personality and presence has just done a complete 180 and I am not fun to be around. She had so much patience and so much effort, but she just got a me-shaped disappointment in return. Nothing but anxieties, messy rooms and bare fridges. No joy and interest in the world around me. We could not talk or communicate about anything anymore. I feel like I am just listing through life. I honestly realise that it is better for her that she does not have to burden herself with someone like my current state (I know fully that it is a burden). I just hope that, maybe someday, she can see the ""real"" me again and we can go back to how things were at the beginning. How things were for me in the months before. I guess I am still upset that things had to end this way. it is my fault and I have to live with that. I know I have to improve and I am filled with hope that I can get myself out of this deep pit I find myself in, but part of me is afraid that I will not ever be able to.

"me and an ex had stopped talking last june for the final time. ever since then its been hell. it was a constant cycle of unblocking eachother and talking for a day then doing it again until one day she just told me she did not want to talk anymore and blocked me for the final time. a few months after that were the worst months of my life. barely going out of my room, eating once or twice a day small meals, sleeping the entire day, doing nothing. i handled it by myself and never told my parents or family about it, as i did not want to go see a therapist. i did not have any good friends to help me through it either. the feeling went away but now i just find myself getting more sad and irritated. I am not going anywhere in life. why am i still sad over stuff that happened over a year ago",depression

"I don’t like it when people ask me how I am Because I am trying to not think about all the negative things that I am going through and as soon as someone asks me this question, it reminds me that things are not okay and I get sad.

Not only that, but 9/10 times, people ask this question because it became a habit and not because they ACTUALLY care how you are. It has become just an addition or an alternative to ""hello"". I only ask people how they are if they seem to not be in a good mood and I would actually care to find out what's wrong. Someone might say ""what if they may not seem sad but still have something wrong with them?"" Then that most likely means that they are hiding it and that they would rather not talk about it (like many of us).

I always say that I am fine just because I don't want to explain to them my issues because they would not understand at all and I know this because I have tried this MANY times.

"Hi, first of all I want to apologize for any mistakes I make since english is not my first language. I just wanted to share my story dealing with depression and well just write down some random things I do that have been helping me out a lot lately. I am 23 years old and my depression has affected my life in so many ways that every time I look back on the things I lost because of it I cannot help but cry, I start having suicidal thoughts and then I just feel like the thought of not belonging anywhere and seeing how my mental state has affected me and my family (Especially my Mom) is slowly killing me. I have dropped out from three different Music colleges because I could not get myself to wake up every morning, I could not believe in myself enough. I found comfort in escaping life via Videogames, Anime, any form of digital media that could allow me to zone out and stop looking at my life. I found comfort in smoking, because killing myself slowly is a great way to deal with the pain. I do not know when and why all this started, I did not realize I had spent more than a year inside my bedroom barely moving, eating or talking to people, I do not know when I became aware that I was making my mother extremely worried and her live as a single parent extremely difficult. All I knew was that seeing that suffering made me want to move I have wasted 5 years of my life, of my familys life and I have nothing to show for it but an immense guilt that fills my chest with what can only be described as a thousand knifes. This is long and boring so Ill stop, point is a month ago I was finally able to start doing things to improve, things that help me wake up every morning and feel like I can try another day. If anyone out there finds this helpful in anyway, I hope this things can help you too. I started working out every day, as hard as it was to start it is as hard if not harder to look at who I was before I started. I started learning a language and I have been studying everyday. I started playing the piano and singing again everyday. I decided to start eating healthier, to go out for walks or just sit a cafe and listen to my favorite songs. I have been trying to cut down smoking, videogames, everything and just try to do it in healthier amounts. I am still unemployed but I am planning to go to school again starting September, this time I want to graduate and finally be able to help my mom. Just do the things you love, love your body, your mind and your soul. You are not alone and you will never be. Thank you, for reading this unnecessarily long thread. Hope this can be of use to somebody out there. Lots of love to all of you. Depressed and (was) seeking help.",depression
I am living by myself for the past week and I realized how alone I am without people living with me and just solidified my thoughts of being an afterthought.

Now that I am sitting here in an empty house it just makes me feel worse.Why cannot I just be okay? I want a life where I am not constantly depressed or have someone to at least help me out sometimes.How do you cope with depression when no one is there for you?

"tw// eating disorder? not sure if it is or if the tw is needed but just in caseI think this will be all over the place as I am still not sure if it makes sense and am just wrapping my head around it, but I will try. Okay, so I always loved eating, it was a big source of comfort and joy ever since I was a kid (20s now). When I was 18 or 19 (when I started college and started spending more time with my peers as I moved into a new city) I started realizing that I might have an unhealthy relationship with food, as I was binge eating on the daily basis and just started seeing that people around me do not consume the food the way I do, like for example they would stop eating when full. By that point I had always just assumed that everyone ate enormous quantities of food and that it is normal for food to play such a crucial role in ones life.I was also and still am heavily depressed throughout all these years and around the time the first lockdowns were happening last year (early 2020) I realized I was getting high so I can eat more/open up my apatite. I know that it probably started way earlier (I started smoking when I was a freshmen in HS) but that is the first time I noticed the direct link. I mostly eat junk food, such as hamburgers, chips, ice cream basically all the crap you can think of. At some point I ate melted chocolate and canned cream for breakfast. I am pretty sure I gained 60 or 65lbs since I left my hometown which then in return directly makes my depression even worse. So I have been feeling like I am trapped in a vicious cycle for a while now.A couple of months ago I started having days, sometimes multiple in a row, where I would not eat at all or crave any food. I would just feel nauseous by the mere thought of eating anything. There are still days when I binge eat but I feel disgusted and nauseous by the food and the act itself while it is happening whereas before I enjoyed it. Even when I am having a regular-sized meal I sometimes feel disgusted. I was walking around the supermarket today and realized I had not eaten anything in 2 days and that I have no cravings whatsoever. So, I do not know where to go from here? Is this a good thing, that I am disgusted by binge eating (I still do it tho)? Is the feeling of nausea coming from the junk food or is this an eating problem or am I just getting older and not being able to eat as much as I used to and the crap I used to? I know the obvious answer is seek professional help but I would like to hear any thoughts or advice that you might have as I am not even sure what is happening.To anyone that has taken their time to read this, thank you I am disgusted by food",depression

"1am thoughts Lord help me. 
I need your guidance for what to do with my life. 
I need someone to talk to. My life is a disappointment. 

I want to give back to my parents, what I am now is because of them. It hurts me seeing them getting old as time goes by.

 I haven't achieved anything in life. My thoughts are drowning me. Always too tired even without doing anything. Tired of life, only sleep is my therapy. 

My partner has her own problems, she's too busy with everything. My closest friends have left me. I dont want my parents to worry. My brother has his own family. I don't have anyone to confide to. Life is draining me to my core. 

Never felt so alone in my life. People are around me everyday but no one seems to care. I've been pretending to be okay for the longest time. I'm no longer my previous self, the confident one, the know it all, the positive guy. I have no ambition, no expectations, all I care now is how to finish the day. This has been my lowest state, my whole body is aching, my soul is hurting, my brain decided to stopped working. 

I miss myself. I miss being happy. I miss being at the moment. I miss celebrating life. I miss being intimate with someone. I miss competing. I miss my family. I miss my friends. I miss waking up excited. I miss caring. I miss eating with people. I miss being motivated. I miss having a purpose. I miss having a goal.

"TW: SUICIDE ATTEMPTI am 24F my father is 45MI am so beyond pissed, shocked, disappointed, heartbroken, intensely sad. I am sorry if I cannot find the right words right now. This all just happened, and I have no one to talk to about this safe for my Therapist soon. I spoke to Crisis Text Line, and I am at least not shaking anymore. They gave me resources for my brother, how I can help him.My brother tried to hang himself today. My mom walked out of his room crying, I heard him crying. My mom told me that my brother tried to hang himself. I was in shock, I STILL am in shock. I never wanted my younger brother to feel this way. Ever. As soon as my mom told me this my Dad (who lives states away) started blowing up my phone. I was shaking, trying to speak to someone with crisis text line to get my own bearings. My mother explicitly told me not to answer, because we both knew he would only put more strain on my brother. We could not answer my Dad because we were trying to a.) process (literally JUST happened) and b.) help my brother get to the hospital without having to worry about our dad freaking out. Meanwhile my dad is calling, calling. Calling me cruel, saying that it is wrong to keep him in the dark. Finally I snapped and texted him:""I do not know why you cannot be understanding or considerate of other people's states and emotions. We are trying to figure out what is wrong and mom will tell you. We are not being cruel to you, we are focused on (My brother) right now. Please understand that. It is okay, when we know what is up we will tell you. I promise.""One of His responses (out of the sea of calls and messages) was:""Because you cannot leave a parent in the dark. I did not even know if he was still alive. You cannot do that.""I told him ""(My brother) tried to kill himself. He is not physically hurt, he is okay. We did not want to tell you because we did not want you to freak out while we were trying to focus on HIM and get HIM to the help he needed as soon as possible. He is not physically hurt, but we need to focus on him right now. I am pretty pissed and disappointed right now to be honest that my own grown father cannot possibly understand there are things he cannot know right as soon as they happen.""To which he responded ""I should have known first"" I REALLY snapped then and said:""Why would you have to be the first person to know? What benefit would that have had for (My brother)? Or just yourself? Yes, let us pause everything (My brother) is going through, pause taking him to the hospital, pause being there for HIM. To cater to you. I am so pissed off right now I should not even be talking to you. This is about (My brother) and you made it about you."" To which he responded ""I think you are out of your mind"" Tell me. Am I out of my mind? Am I in the wrong, genuinely? Because if I am I want to know. I wanted to get help for my brother, my brother and his safety--what was immediately in front of us we had to take care of and my dad is really begrudging US for not telling him until 30 minutes when we could, what happened.

"each task even as simple as getting out of bed seems too much for me sometimes- it is hard to describe depression in words but metaphorically speaking, it feels like you are in the water drowning and trying to stay afloat at the same time. I have lost so much in my life, I could not think of one person to call or text to talk to . I feel like if I even talk about having depression, people would just dismiss me just life they have done so in the past with comments such as ""you are too young to have depression"" (I am 21), ""other people have it much worse"", ""you probably just sad try to be happy"". I feel like it is an endless cycle and it is a cycle I am getting increasingly tired of and I cannot seem to fight anymore. Everyone has given up on me and I feel like I am giving up on me too.

"I (33F) have been struggling with depression for quite some time. Back in 2019 I was seeing a psychiatrist as well as a therapist. I was taking Prozac to help with my depression. Overall I was beginning to feel good. Unfortunately, all that ended when my boss outsourced our jobs to India and I lost my insurance. Fast forward to the present, I am still without insurance and have not been able to afford therapy and meds on my own yet. My work has been really unsteady. With that said, I currently work 7 days a week, while my BF (36) works UberEats for 4-5 hours a day M-F. When I leave for work in the mornings, he is asleep. He does not start until 10:30 -11am. When I come home, I usually find him playing video games or on the bed on his phone watching porn or dumb shit. I do most of the cleaning at home, which includes washing dishes- to which I hate with a passion, but since I do not cook, that was our agreement. Lately though, I have been more active in the kitchen so I am considering switching our roles. Sex- He likes to be pegged. Which I happily do and enjoy. I genuinely get into the moment which tends to result in 2-3 orgasms for him. He has it good! I recently had this conversation with him expressing that I would like for him to initiate sex with me more often. However, our pose is usually 1 of the following 3; missionary, cowgirl, or stomach down/doggy. I can only orgasm with 2 of those positions. There is still a lack of initiation from his end. Maybe I should be more vocal... but I feel like at that point, it becomes a chore, which is not sexy. Plus how many times do I have to repeat it? that is the bad... the good is that he loves me. He tells me everyday how much he adores me. As far as I know, he is honest with me. Whatever I want, he does. he is supportive and encouraging. I love him. I do, but sometimes I also feel a little of resentment. Why am I breaking my back to fuck him and support our lifestyle. I have been so stressed out lately. Like I mentioned, my work has been pretty inconsistent. I have a breakdown almost everyday! Sometimes, I want to break up with him, but I can never go through with it because when I truly think about it, I do not want to. I just feel like I am stretching myself thin. Circling back to the porn I mentioned. He masturbates every morning before he leaves for work. His Reddit feed is mostly porn. he is into big proportions. I was not giften with much assets in the rear... and it makes me very insecure. Plus I am a little over my ideal weight. I am beginning to wonder if my depression is affecting my relationship, or if my relationship is affecting my depression. Any feedback would be appreciated it. Is my boyfriend adding to my depression?",depression
