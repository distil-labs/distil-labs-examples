# Problem setting

Imagine you work for an e-commerce platform and need to develop an automated system to categorize product listings based on their descriptions. In such a system, improving classification accuracy leads to better product discoverability, streamlined seller experience, and enhanced customer satisfaction - key business metrics we aim to optimize.

We will base our example on a comprehensive [e-commerce dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/ecommerce-text-classification/data) that contains product descriptions and their corresponding categories, focusing on the four main categories that represent ~80% of typical e-commerce inventory:
- Electronics
- Household items
- Books
- Clothing & Accessories

The dataset has two columns containing the category label and the product description (including title and details).
