"India's Wars: A Military History, 1947-1971 Review ""This book is a good introduction to the subject. It is generally quite detailed when it comes to the IAF.... The author has a definite political and ideological agenda [and] the details are accurate.... Well worth a read."" --Brown Pundits ""India's Wars is an eminently readable work on the Indian military and India's experiences with wars over a period of roughly twenty-five years after independence. Given the serious neglect of military history in the understanding of India's contemporary history (post-1947), this is a notable contribution.... Subramaniam has provided us with a useful and thought-provoking book on India's wars until 1971, and one hopes that the next volume on the period after the Bangladesh War will be equally engaging."" --H-Asia ""Retired Indian Air Vice Marshal Subramaniam, who is now an instructor at the Indian National Defence College, has produced a comprehensive history of India's armed forces and their wars, from the First Indo-Pakistan War in 1947, which was sparked by partition and independence through the Third, sometimes known as the Bangladesh War in 1971.... Subramaniam's treatment of policy, strategy, and operations is very good, and his description of tactical encounters are well written, integrating air, ground, and naval operations as appropriate, and are pretty easy to follow.... India's Wars offers an excellent overview of Indian military history since independence for both the professional military historian or the interested layman."" --StrategyPage ""The battle for Goa was an early example of a combined operation for the Indian military, combining land, air, and sea elements. It is one small piece of a growing heritage for that nation, a history that is well told in this book. The work is impressive in its readability and clarity, as the author does not presume any foreknowledge of his subject and strives to make clear a subject relatively unknown in the Western world. The work deftly traces India's military origins in the 20th century."" --Military Heritage ""[Subramaniam] offers a richly detailed history of India's wars with Pakistan, China, and Portugal as well as a balanced appraisal of India's military wartime performance, highlighting successes and failures."" --Military Officer ""Arjun Subramaniam has blazed a trail for other Indian military officers to follow. By carefully analyzing India's early post-independence wars from a joint perspective, he has contributed toward improving not only professional military education in India, but hopefully the conduct of Indian national security policy itself. A magnificent achievement!"" --Ashley J. Tellis, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace ""Deftly telescoping six decades of India's conflicts in a single volume, Arjun Subramaniam presents an objective and compelling tri-service narrative which I found hard to put down. He joins a select band of service officers who have, in the tradition of Thucydides, shown the intellectual acumen as well as courage and perseverance to put pen to paper while still in uniform."" --Admiral Arun Prakash, Indian Navy, (Ret.), former Chief of Naval Staff and Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee ""India's Wars is a very readable and fascinating book that is not simply a recitation of events, but a work punctuated with insights that can be realized only by someone who participated in the events. Providing views of India's military pioneers not previously available, it also addresses the political interactions that are integral to conflict. This is a timely book yielding understanding of India's military history when India's influence on critical geopolitical events is growing."" --Lt. Gen. David A. Deptula, USAF (Ret.); Dean of the Mitchell Institute of Aerospace Power Studies ""In this turbulent twenty-first century, the rise of India will be critical for understanding global geopolitics. This superb overview of India's military history in the twentieth century is essential to appreciate the role of India in the decades to come."" --Adm. James Stavridis, USN (Ret.), sixteenth Supreme Allied Commander, NATO; Dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University 				    	 					 About the Author Arjun Subramaniam is a serving Air Vice Marshal in the Indian Air Force. A fighter pilot who has commanded a fighter squadron and a large flying base, he also has a PhD in Defence and Strategic Studies. A prolific writer and speaker on military history, air power and national security, he is currently posted as a faculty member at the National Defence College, New Delhi.",books

"Rich Dad, Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money - That the Poor and the Middle Class Do Not! Robert T. Kiyosaki learned early on that the real reason the rich get richer and the poor get poorer fix the financial savvy passed down from one generation to the next, rather than the money itself. RICH DAD, POOR DAD uses the author's two ""fathers"" -- one, an entrepreneur who mentored Kiyosaki, and his real father, an academic -- as models of two starkly different approaches to finance. Kiyosaki's many insights for individual investors include: -- How to raise capital for investments without going to the bank-- Why a high salary alone can't create real wealth-- Why ""study hard, get good grades, find a secure job"" is the most dangerous advice a parent can give About The Author: About the Author Robert Kiyosaki was born and raised in Hawaii, and is a fourth-generation Japanese-American. He attended college in New York, and after graduating, joined the Marine Corps and served in Vietnam as an officer and helicopter gunship pilot. After the war, Robert worked for the Xerox Corporation as a salesman. In 1977, he started a company that brought the first nylon Velcro 'surfer wallets' to market. In 1985 he founded an international education company that taught business and investing to students throughout the world. In 1994 Robert sold his business and retired at the age of 47. During this somewhat short-lived retirement, Robert, collaborating with co-author Sharon Lechter, a C.P.A. and his business partner, wrote the bestselling book ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"".",books

"Talking to My Daughter About the Economy: A Brief History of Capitalism Review ""If you're Left-wing, or even if you have doubts about market economies, you'll love his arguments because they're so easy to understand. If you're on the Right, you'll have a very clear idea of how your cleverest opponents think ... Varoufakis tells all this with exemplary verve ... It's great fun to read ... Varoufakis has started a debate here, and he's done it brilliantly"" (Evening Standard)""Utterly accessible, deeply humane and startlingly original – a potent democratic tool at the perfect time"" (Naomi Klein, author of No Is Not Enough)""A provocative, challenging, yet non-patronising analysis of the global economy: what it is, how it came to be and why it can never be apolitical. By using ancient myths, contemporary culture and family stories, Varoufakis makes the text intimate and accessible"" (Nigel Jones Observer)""Experts have often found it easier to hide behind opaque language than to explain complex concepts in simple terms … Varoufakis wants to smash this barrier: he argues from the outset that if we defer to experts on the economy then we hand over all our most important political decisions to them … Varoufakis does equip his readers with the beginnings of a new language, and punctures myth after myth"" (Anna Minton Guardian)""Varoufakis's brief history of capitalism unspools with characteristic fluency and verve ... those seeking to better understand the 'black magic' of bankers should look no further"" (Financial Times)""A stimulating and elegant perspective on market economies. It is accessible but not simplistic … A superb chapter on banking ... provocative and stylish"" (Paschal Donohoe Irish Times)""One of the most accurate and detailed descriptions of modern power ever written"" (Guardian on Adults In The Room)""Varoufakis has the greatest political virtues of all – courage and honesty"" (The Times)""One of my few heroes. As long as people like Varoufakis are around, there still is hope"" (Slavoj Zizek)""Superbly written ... he was – and is – right"" (Martin Wolf, Financial Times, on Adults in the Room) 				    	 					 About the Author Born in Athens in 1961, Yanis Varoufakis was for many years a professor of economics in Britain, Australia and the USA before becoming finance minister of Greece in 2015.

Rohan Agarwal has been appointed the manager of a play, and how excited he is to work with Chandni Joshi - his childhood crush, and unfortunately, his senior! A happy-go-lucky high school boarder, he has his fun with his friends, enjoys the odd sport and does not think twice before raiding his warden's office to leak question papers. Then, one misty night, he sneaks into the infamous Green Room; and there, he finds something that wasn't meant to be found... Mysterious happenings in the Green Room begin to follow.
