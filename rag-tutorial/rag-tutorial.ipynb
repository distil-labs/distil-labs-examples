    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This hands‑on tutorial begins with a quick baseline RAG prototype for Roman‑Empire question‑answering and uses it as a **stepping stone toward the real objective: running a fully local Retrieval‑Augmented Generation system powered by a fine‑tuned small language model (SLM) that you train with the distil labs platform and then serve on your own hardware.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Chapter 1 – Build a local RAG system**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Launch a lightweight chat model locally with **vLLM**.\n",
    "  * Chunk a Wikipedia article, embed the chunks with **HuggingFace sentence‑transformers**, and store them in an **in‑memory vector store**.\n",
    "  * Glue retrieval and generation together in a minimal **RAG class**, then test the loop end‑to‑end.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Chapter 2 – Specialize an SLM for local RAG**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Collect a *tiny* labelled QA set plus the unstructured passages you just indexed.\n",
    "  * Upload them to **distil labs**, evaluate a powerful teacher LLM, and fine‑tune a 135 M‑parameter student model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Chapter 3 – Rerun the RAG loop with the fine‑tuned model**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Serve the freshly trained weights locally with vLLM.\n",
    "  * Drop the tuned model into the same RAG class and observe the quality gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end you will have a fully working RAG system that you can run on a laptop, plus a recipe for squeezing extra accuracy out of modest hardware by distilling knowledge from a large model into a small one."

The Romans did not follow linguistic imperialism to achieve power or political superiority. However, there is evidence that local languages, particularly in Egypt, Fulham, and Syria, were favored by Roman administrators for use of internal administrative documents, official communications, private letters, and policy matters. Palmyrene interpreters served the military and had their own language for quotations and proclamations. In Africa, Palmyrene soldiers used their dialect of Aramaic for inscriptions, an attempt by the Roman Empire to inform the right knowledge. Linguistic diversity would have made Rome's various officials and officials' efforts to use local languages common throughout the empire.\n",

Caxton's \"New World\" editions included production in English and by over the materials.\n",
