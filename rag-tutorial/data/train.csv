Who created the authoritative Latin translation of the Bible known as the Vulgate?
","
Jerome produced the Vulgate translation in the late 4th century.
","From the 2nd to the 4th centuries, Christian authors were in active dialogue with the classical tradition. Tertullian was one of the earliest prose authors with a distinctly Christian voice. After the conversion of Constantine, Latin literature is dominated by the Christian perspective. In the late 4th century, Jerome produced the Latin translation of the Bible that became authoritative as the Vulgate. Around that same time, Augustine wrote The City of God against the Pagans, considered ""a masterpiece of Western culture"".
In contrast to the unity of Classical Latin, the literary esthetic of late antiquity has a tessellated quality. A continuing interest in the religious traditions of Rome prior to Christian dominion is found into the 5th century, with the Saturnalia of Macrobius and The Marriage of Philology and Mercury of Martianus Capella. Latin poets of late antiquity include Ausonius, Prudentius, Claudian, and Sidonius Apollinaris."

What was the Roman Empire's approach to handling local religious beliefs in conquered territories?
","
Rather than suppressing local deities, the Romans incorporated them into their religious system by building temples and allowing simultaneous worship of both Roman and local gods.
","The Romans are known for the great number of deities they honoured. As the Romans extended their territories, their general policy was to promote stability among diverse peoples by absorbing local deities and cults rather than eradicating them, building temples that framed local theology within Roman religion. Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local gods. By the height of the Empire, numerous syncretic or reinterpreted gods were cultivated, among them cults of Cybele, Isis, Epona, and of solar gods such as Mithras and Sol Invictus, found as far north as Roman Britain. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one god or cult only, religious tolerance was not an issue."

What evidence suggests that Roman nutrition and health might have been worse compared to other historical periods?
","
Height measurements indicate that Romans were generally shorter than both their pre-Roman Italian predecessors and medieval Europeans.
",The importance of a good diet to health was recognized by medical writers such as Galen (2nd century). Views on nutrition were influenced by beliefs like humoral theory. A good indicator of nutrition and disease burden is average height: the average Roman was shorter in stature than the population of pre-Roman Italian societies and medieval Europe.

What was the social status of artists in ancient Rome despite their work being highly valued?
","
Despite creating valued artwork, Roman artists maintained a low social status primarily because they performed manual labor.
","== Arts ==

Greek art had a profound influence on Roman art. Public art—including sculpture, monuments such as victory columns or triumphal arches, and the iconography on coins—is often analysed for historical or ideological significance. In the private sphere, artistic objects were made for religious dedications, funerary commemoration, domestic use, and commerce. The wealthy advertised their appreciation of culture through artwork and decorative arts in their homes. Despite the value placed on art, even famous artists were of low social status, partly as they worked with their hands.

What was the basic unit of currency in the early Roman Empire?
","
The sestertius served as the fundamental unit of monetary value until the 4th century, with four sesterces equaling one silver denarius.
","The early Empire was monetized to a near-universal extent, using money as a way to express prices and debts. The sestertius (English ""sesterces"", symbolized as HS) was the basic unit of reckoning value into the 4th century, though the silver denarius, worth four sesterces, was also used beginning in the Severan dynasty. The smallest coin commonly circulated was the bronze as, one-tenth denarius. Bullion and ingots seem not to have counted as pecunia (""money"") and were used only on the frontiers. Romans in the first and second centuries counted coins, rather than weighing them—an indication that the coin was valued on its face. This tendency towards fiat money led to the debasement of Roman coinage in the later Empire. The standardization of money throughout the Empire promoted trade and market integration. The high amount of metal coinage in circulation increased the money supply for trading or saving."

What was the Cura Annonae and why was it important for Roman society?
","
The Cura Annonae was a state-provided grain dole that helped maintain social stability by improving living conditions for lower-class Romans while consuming 15% of state revenues.
","Maintaining an affordable food supply to the city of Rome had become a major political issue in the late Republic, when the state began to provide a grain dole (Cura Annonae) to citizens who registered for it (about 200,000–250,000 adult males in Rome). The dole cost at least 15% of state revenues, but improved living conditions among the lower classes, and subsidized the rich by allowing workers to spend more of their earnings on the wine and olive oil produced on estates. The grain dole also had symbolic value: it affirmed the emperor's position as universal benefactor, and the right of citizens to share in ""the fruits of conquest"". The annona, public facilities, and spectacular entertainments mitigated the otherwise dreary living conditions of lower-class Romans, and kept social unrest in check. The satirist Juvenal, however, saw ""bread and circuses"" (panem et circenses) as emblematic of the loss of republican political liberty:"

What was the typical tax rate for individuals in the Roman Empire?
","
Individual Romans typically paid between 2 to 5 percent in taxes during the Empire period.
","Taxation under the Empire amounted to about 5% of its gross product. The typical tax rate for individuals ranged from 2 to 5%. The tax code was ""bewildering"" in its complicated system of direct and indirect taxes, some paid in cash and some in kind. Taxes might be specific to a province, or kinds of properties such as fisheries; they might be temporary. Tax collection was justified by the need to maintain the military, and taxpayers sometimes got a refund if the army captured a surplus of booty. In-kind taxes were accepted from less-monetized areas, particularly those who could supply grain or goods to army camps."

How did social status affect legal punishment in the Roman Empire after 212 AD?
","
Members of the upper class (honestiores) could receive lighter punishments like fines while lower class citizens (humiliores) faced harsher physical penalties for the same crimes.
","As the republican principle of citizens' equality under the law faded, the symbolic and social privileges of the upper classes led to an informal division of Roman society into those who had acquired greater honours (honestiores) and humbler folk (humiliores). In general, honestiores were the members of the three higher ""orders"", along with certain military officers. The granting of universal citizenship in 212 seems to have increased the competitive urge among the upper classes to have their superiority affirmed, particularly within the justice system. Sentencing depended on the judgment of the presiding official as to the relative ""worth"" (dignitas) of the defendant: an honestior could pay a fine for a crime for which an humilior might receive a scourging."

What legal protections were introduced for slaves during the Roman Empire under Augustus and his successors?
","
Slaves gained the right to file complaints against their masters and were protected from forced castration and prostitution through specific legislation.
","Following the Servile Wars of the Republic, legislation under Augustus and his successors shows a driving concern for controlling the threat of rebellions through limiting the size of work groups, and for hunting down fugitive slaves. Over time slaves gained increased legal protection, including the right to file complaints against their masters. A bill of sale might contain a clause stipulating that the slave could not be employed for prostitution, as prostitutes in ancient Rome were often slaves. The burgeoning trade in eunuchs in the late 1st century prompted legislation that prohibited the castration of a slave against his will ""for lust or gain""."

How did common Romans prepare their meals in their apartments?
","
Most Romans had no proper kitchen and could only do basic cooking using a charcoal brazier, so they often relied on prepared food from vendors and establishments.
","Most apartments in Rome lacked kitchens, though a charcoal brazier could be used for rudimentary cookery. Prepared food was sold at pubs and bars, inns, and food stalls (tabernae, cauponae, popinae, thermopolia). Carryout and restaurants were for the lower classes; fine dining appeared only at dinner parties in wealthy homes with a chef (archimagirus) and kitchen staff, or banquets hosted by social clubs (collegia).
Most Romans consumed at least 70% of their daily calories in the form of cereals and legumes. Puls (pottage) was considered the food of the Romans, and could be elaborated to produce dishes similar to polenta or risotto. Urban populations and the military preferred bread. By the reign of Aurelian, the state had begun to distribute the annona as a daily ration of bread baked in state factories, and added olive oil, wine, and pork to the dole."

What were the benefits of serving in the auxilia for non-citizens?
","
After 25 years of service, auxiliary soldiers and their sons were granted Roman citizenship, although they received lower pay than legionaries.
","The auxilia were recruited from among the non-citizens. Organized in smaller units of roughly cohort strength, they were paid less than the legionaries, and after 25 years of service were rewarded with Roman citizenship, also extended to their sons. According to Tacitus there were roughly as many auxiliaries as there were legionaries—thus, around 125,000 men, implying approximately 250 auxiliary regiments. The Roman cavalry of the earliest Empire were primarily from Celtic, Hispanic or Germanic areas. Several aspects of training and equipment derived from the Celts.
The Roman navy not only aided in the supply and transport of the legions but also in the protection of the frontiers along the rivers Rhine and Danube. Another duty was protecting maritime trade against pirates. It patrolled the Mediterranean, parts of the North Atlantic coasts, and the Black Sea. Nevertheless, the army was considered the senior and more prestigious branch."

How did wealthy Romans display their social status and prestige?
","
Wealthy Romans demonstrated their prestige by investing in estates, luxury goods, public entertainment, monuments, and religious offerings.
","Economic dynamism resulted in social mobility. Although aristocratic values permeated traditional elite society, wealth requirements for rank indicate a strong tendency towards plutocracy. Prestige could be obtained through investing one's wealth in grand estates or townhouses, luxury items, public entertainments, funerary monuments, and religious dedications. Guilds (collegia) and corporations (corpora) provided support for individuals to succeed through networking. ""There can be little doubt that the lower classes of ... provincial towns of the Roman Empire enjoyed a high standard of living not equaled again in Western Europe until the 19th century"". Households in the top 1.5% of income distribution captured about 20% of income. The ""vast majority"" produced more than half of the total income, but lived near subsistence."

How did Augustus's moral legislation treat adultery differently for men and women?
","
While married women could only have sex with their husbands, married men were allowed to have relations with prostitutes and people of lower status without being considered adulterers.
","As part of the Augustan programme to restore traditional morality and social order, moral legislation attempted to regulate conduct as a means of promoting ""family values"". Adultery was criminalized, and defined broadly as an illicit sex act (stuprum) between a male citizen and a married woman, or between a married woman and any man other than her husband. That is, a double standard was in place: a married woman could have sex only with her husband, but a married man did not commit adultery if he had sex with a prostitute or person of marginalized status. Childbearing was encouraged: a woman who had given birth to three children was granted symbolic honours and greater legal freedom (the ius trium liberorum).

What was the significance of the toga praetexta in Roman society?
","
The toga praetexta, marked by its purple or purplish-red stripe, was a special garment reserved for children, curule magistrates, and state priests, symbolizing their protected status.
","In a status-conscious society like that of the Romans, clothing and personal adornment indicated the etiquette of interacting with the wearer. Wearing the correct clothing reflected a society in good order. There is little direct evidence of how Romans dressed in daily life, since portraiture may show the subject in clothing with symbolic value, and surviving textiles are rare.
The toga was the distinctive national garment of the male citizen, but it was heavy and impractical, worn mainly for conducting political or court business and religious rites. It was a ""vast expanse"" of semi-circular white wool that could not be put on and draped correctly without assistance. The drapery became more intricate and structured over time. The toga praetexta, with a purple or purplish-red stripe representing inviolability, was worn by children who had not come of age, curule magistrates, and state priests. Only the emperor could wear an all-purple toga (toga picta)."

Who were the emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty after Augustus?
","
The Julio-Claudian dynasty continued with Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero until 69 AD.
","=== Pax Romana ===

The 200 years that began with Augustus's rule is traditionally regarded as the Pax Romana (""Roman Peace""). The cohesion of the empire was furthered by a degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced. Uprisings in the provinces were infrequent and put down ""mercilessly and swiftly"". The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs. The Julio-Claudian dynasty lasted for four more emperors—Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero—before it yielded in 69 AD to the strife-torn Year of the Four Emperors, from which Vespasian emerged as the victor. Vespasian became the founder of the brief Flavian dynasty, followed by the Nerva–Antonine dynasty which produced the ""Five Good Emperors"": Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius.

How did Rome's transition from a conscript army to a professional military force change their military service structure?
","
Professional soldiers in the Roman army volunteered for a 25-year commitment, serving 20 years of active duty and 5 years as reserves.
","=== Military ===

After the Punic Wars, the Roman army comprised professional soldiers who volunteered for 20 years of active duty and five as reserves. The transition to a professional military began during the late Republic and was one of the many profound shifts away from republicanism, under which an army of conscript citizens defended the homeland against a specific threat. The Romans expanded their war machine by ""organizing the communities that they conquered in Italy into a system that generated huge reservoirs of manpower for their army"". By Imperial times, military service was a full-time career. The pervasiveness of military garrisons throughout the Empire was a major influence in the process of Romanization.
The primary mission of the military of the early empire was to preserve the Pax Romana. The three major divisions of the military were:"

What rights and freedoms did Roman women citizens have?
","
While Roman women couldn't vote or hold office, they had significant economic freedoms including the right to own property, conduct business, and manage their wealth independently.
","Freeborn Roman women were considered citizens, but did not vote, hold political office, or serve in the military. A mother's citizen status determined that of her children, as indicated by the phrase ex duobus civibus Romanis natos (""children born of two Roman citizens""). A Roman woman kept her own family name (nomen) for life. Children most often took the father's name, with some exceptions. Women could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business. Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works, an indication they could hold considerable fortunes."

To become a Roman Senator, one needed to serve as an executive magistrate, possess at least 1 million sestertii in property, and maintain legal residence in Rome.
","""Senator"" was not itself an elected office in ancient Rome; an individual gained admission to the Senate after he had been elected to and served at least one term as an executive magistrate. A senator also had to meet a minimum property requirement of 1 million sestertii. Not all men who qualified for the ordo senatorius chose to take a Senate seat, which required legal domicile at Rome. Emperors often filled vacancies in the 600-member body by appointment. A senator's son belonged to the ordo senatorius, but he had to qualify on his own merits for admission to the Senate. A senator could be removed for violating moral standards."

","Roman religion was practical and contractual, based on the principle of do ut des, ""I give that you might give"". Religion depended on knowledge and the correct practice of prayer, ritual, and sacrifice, not on faith or dogma, although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine. For ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life. Each home had a household shrine to offer prayers and libations to the family's domestic deities. Neighbourhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances; as many as 135 days were devoted to religious festivals and games (ludi)."

Who was responsible for the most severe persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire?
","
Diocletian carried out the harshest persecution of Christians during a period from 303 to 311 AD.
","Christianity emerged in Roman Judaea as a Jewish religious sect in the 1st century and gradually spread out of Jerusalem throughout the Empire and beyond. Imperially authorized persecutions were limited and sporadic, with martyrdoms occurring most often under the authority of local officials. Tacitus reports that after the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64, the emperor attempted to deflect blame from himself onto the Christians. A major persecution occurred under the emperor Domitian and a persecution in 177 took place at Lugdunum, the Gallo-Roman religious capital. A letter from Pliny the Younger, governor of Bithynia, describes his persecution and executions of Christians. The Decian persecution of 246–251 seriously threatened the Christian Church, but ultimately strengthened Christian defiance. Diocletian undertook the most severe persecution of Christians, from 303 to 311."

In the Dominate, clothing worn by both soldiers and bureaucrats became highly decorated with geometrical patterns, stylized plant motifs, and in more elaborate examples, human or animal figures. Courtiers of the later Empire wore elaborate silk robes.

How did the wealthy Roman aristocracy's tax behavior affect the Empire?

The resistance of wealthy Romans to paying taxes contributed to the Empire's eventual downfall while they continued accumulating vast personal fortunes.
","Low taxes helped the Roman aristocracy increase their wealth, which equalled or exceeded the revenues of the central government.

How did the Roman government support agriculture during Augustus' time?
","
The government promoted agricultural development through crop rotation, selective breeding, and the introduction of new crops across different provinces.
","Augustus' programme of urban renewal, and the growth of Rome's population to as many as one million, was accompanied by nostalgia for rural life. Poetry idealized the lives of farmers and shepherds. Interior decorating often featured painted gardens, fountains, landscapes, vegetative ornament, and animals, rendered accurately enough to be identified by species. On a more practical level, the central government took an active interest in supporting agriculture. Producing food was the priority of land use. Larger farms (latifundia) achieved an economy of scale that sustained urban life. Small farmers benefited from the development of local markets in towns and trade centres. Agricultural techniques such as crop rotation and selective breeding were disseminated throughout the Empire, and new crops were introduced from one province to another."

How did the Romans deal with books they considered dangerous or treasonous?
","
Books deemed subversive were publicly burned, and under Domitian's rule, copyists were crucified for reproducing treasonous works.
","Collectors amassed personal libraries, and a fine library was part of the cultivated leisure (otium) associated with the villa lifestyle. Significant collections might attract ""in-house"" scholars, and an individual benefactor might endow a community with a library (as Pliny the Younger did in Comum). Imperial libraries were open to users on a limited basis, and represented a literary canon. Books considered subversive might be publicly burned, and Domitian crucified copyists for reproducing works deemed treasonous.
Literary texts were often shared aloud at meals or with reading groups. Public readings (recitationes) expanded from the 1st through the 3rd century, giving rise to ""consumer literature"" for entertainment. Illustrated books, including erotica, were popular, but are poorly represented by extant fragments."

What evidence shows that languages other than Latin and Greek were still used in the Roman Empire?

References to interpreters, legal documents, military inscriptions, and various regional inscriptions demonstrate that local languages like Coptic, Punic, Gaulish, and Aramaic continued to be used throughout the Empire.
","The dominance of Latin and Greek among the literate elite obscure the continuity of other spoken languages within the Empire. Latin, referred to in its spoken form as Vulgar Latin, gradually replaced Celtic and Italic languages. References to interpreters indicate the continuing use of local languages, particularly in Egypt with Coptic, and in military settings along the Rhine and Danube. Roman jurists also show a concern for local languages such as Punic, Gaulish, and Aramaic in assuring the correct understanding of laws and oaths. In Africa, Libyco-Berber and Punic were used in inscriptions into the 2nd century. In Syria, Palmyrene soldiers used their dialect of Aramaic for inscriptions, an exception to the rule that Latin was the language of the military.

While literary theatre used all-male actors with masks, mimus featured both male and female performers without masks and included various entertainment elements like dance, acrobatics, and political satire.
","=== Performing arts ===

In Roman tradition, borrowed from the Greeks, literary theatre was performed by all-male troupes that used face masks with exaggerated facial expressions to portray emotion. Female roles were played by men in drag (travesti). Roman literary theatre tradition is represented in Latin literature by the tragedies of Seneca, for example.
More popular than literary theatre was the genre-defying mimus theatre, which featured scripted scenarios with free improvisation, risqué language and sex scenes, action sequences, and political satire, along with dance, juggling, acrobatics, tightrope walking, striptease, and dancing bears. Unlike literary theatre, mimus was played without masks, and encouraged stylistic realism. Female roles were performed by women. Mimus was related to pantomimus, an early form of story ballet that contained no spoken dialogue but rather a sung libretto, often mythological, either tragic or comic."

A freedman was not entitled to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods, but could play a priestly role. He could not marry a woman from a senatorial family, nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself, but during the early Empire, freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy, so much so that Hadrian limited their participation by law.

How did Pliny the Younger justify the brutality of gladiator spectacles?
","
Pliny claimed that gladiator fights inspired people to be brave and face death honorably by showing the glory and victory possible in combat.
","Modern scholars have found the pleasure Romans took in the ""theatre of life and death"" difficult to understand. Pliny the Younger rationalized gladiator spectacles as good for the people, ""to inspire them to face honourable wounds and despise death, by exhibiting love of glory and desire for victory"". Some Romans such as Seneca were critical of the brutal spectacles, but found virtue in the courage and dignity of the defeated fighter—an attitude that finds its fullest expression with the Christians martyred in the arena. Tertullian considered deaths in the arena to be nothing more than a dressed-up form of human sacrifice. Even martyr literature, however, offers ""detailed, indeed luxuriant, descriptions of bodily suffering"", and became a popular genre at times indistinguishable from fiction."
