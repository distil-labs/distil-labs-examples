# Distil Labs Examples

Welcome to the distil labs Platform - your gateway to effortless model fine-tuning without extensive machine learning expertise.

## Overview

distil labs Platform is a user-friendly solution that democratizes access to state-of-the-art model fine-tuning. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or business professional, you can create custom, high-performance models tailored to your specific needs over night.


## Examples

This repository contains practical examples demonstrating various use cases of the Distil Labs Platform. Each example is contained in its own directory with complete code and documentation.

### **[Text Classification](classification-tutorial)**
This example demonstrates how to fine-tune a small language model (SLM) for text classification using the distil labs platform. You can train a model that solves any of the four example tasks we provide or modify any of the examples to match your use-case. 



## Getting Started


To start working with this repository:
1. Clone this repository (or download as a zip file)
2. Make sure you have python 3.10 or later installed on your machine
