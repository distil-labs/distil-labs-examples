# distil labs examples

Welcome to the distil labs platform - your gateway to effortless model fine-tuning without extensive machine learning expertise.

## Overview

The distil labs platform is a user-friendly solution that democratises access to state-of-the-art model fine-tuning. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or business professional, you can create custom, high-performance models tailored to your specific needs overnight.


## Examples

This repository contains practical examples demonstrating various use cases of the distil labs platform. Each example is contained in its own directory with complete code and documentation.

### Text classification
[This example](classification-tutorial) demonstrates how to fine-tune a small language model (SLM) for text classification using the distil labs platform. You can train a model that solves any of the four example tasks we provide or modify any of the examples to match your use-case. 



## Getting Started
